; Changelog:
;
; Version 1.7.0 (2022/10/20)
; * Updated for the 2022 Witches Festival
;
; Version 1.6.0 (2021/10/21)
; * Updated for the 2021 Witches Festival
;
; Version 1.5.0 (2020/10/22)
; * Updated for the 2020 Witches Festival
;
; Version 1.4.1 (2019/10/25)
; * Adjusted the format of the Dremora Plunder Skull log to reflect the new
;   reset timing
;
; Version 1.4.0 (2019/10/24)
; * Preliminary update for the 2019 Witches Festival; it is unclear if Dremora
;   Plunder Skulls are still on a 20-hour timer or if they have been changed to
;   reset at 0600 UTC, so further adjustments may be needed
;
; Version 1.3.2 (2018/10/20)
; * Reinstated the timer for regular skulls; although the vast majority of
;   regular skull sources are not subject to a cooldown, it appears that some
;   skull sources are still subject to a cooldown
;
; Version 1.3.1 (2018/10/20)
; * Server identity (NA/EU) will now be remembered for newly-acquired skulls;
;   the log display will note if a skull was acquired on a server different than
;   the current server (the server identity will be shown only if the current
;   server is not the skull's origin, and it is not retroactive for any skulls
;   acquired before installing version 1.3.1)
;
; Version 1.3.0 (2018/10/20)
; * Disabled the timer for regular Plunder Skulls
; * The /pstdremora command can now filter by skull type; e.g., if you type
;   "/pstdremora tri", it will show only the skulls whose names contain "tri"
;   (i.e., the Trial skulls); typing "/pstdremora" without a filter term will
;   still show the full log as before
;
; Version 1.2.4 (2018/10/18)
; * Based on forum reports of the cooldown duration, the timestamps for the
;   Dremora Plunder Skull log are now color-coded red if it was less than 20
;   hours ago, and green otherwise
;
; Version 1.2.3 (2018/10/18)
; * Added a chat command (/pstdremora) to show a time log of the Dremora Plunder
;   Skulls you have looted
;
; Version 1.2.2 (2018/10/18)
; * Updated for the 2018 Witches Festival
;
; Version 1.2.1 (2017/10/23)
; * API version bump for Update 16 (Clockwork City)
;
; Version 1.2.0 (2017/10/20)
; * Updated for the 2017 Witches Festival
;
; Version 1.1.1 (2016/10/24)
; * The timer will now start counting from a combat end event, if there was one
;   15 seconds or less before a skull pickup (The game's cooldown starts when
;   the boss is killed, but since there is no way to track that, the addon uses
;   the skull pickup time instead as a close approximation; this change refines
;   that heuristic by using the combat end time, if there was a combat end event
;   shortly before a skull pickup)
;
; Version 1.1.0 (2016/10/17)
; * The timer is now color-coded: red from 00:00 to 2:29, yellow from 2:30 to
;   2:59, and green from 3:00 onwards
; * Right-clicking on the timer will post the current elapsed time into group
;   chat
;
; Version 1.0.1 (2016/10/14)
; * The timer will no longer trigger from skulls looted by group members
;
; Version 1.0.0 (2016/10/14)
; * Initial version
