Getting Started...

After downloading and installing Essential Housing Tools, you will first need to set up two key binds under:

Controls | Housing Editor | Essential Housing Tools

for the following items:

* Show Selection Window
* Select / Deselect

(You can key bind the other items later if you choose to, but these two are fairly essential - pun intended.)

Then, just press your key bind for "Show Selection Window".


If its your first time using the add-on, the Tutorial Tips will be shown as you move through each Tab.

You can always click the "Show tutorial tips" button (circled "I" icon) in the top-left of the add-on's window to see these Tips again at any time.
