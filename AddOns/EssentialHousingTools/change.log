Added an in-world directional / rotational indicator.
 * When the cursor is placed over any of EHT's Forward/Backward, North/South, Rotate/Pitch/Roll buttons,
   an arrow indicates the direction that your selected item(s) will be moved or rotated.
 * You may disable or enable this indicator with:
   Settings | Addons | Essential Housing Tools | Editing Items | Show direction/rotation arrow

Added support for Day / Night Triggers as secondary conditions in order to further expand the possible combinations of trigger conditions.

Fixed an issue that caused Day / Night Triggers to fail to fire when combined with a secondary Location-based condition.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Spiderweb effects to interfere with the coloring of other placed effects.
 * Thank you to Silverrose for helping to identify this issue.


2020-10-04 - 15.7.2

Fixed another issue that caused the default for certain EHT keybinds to always be set even after actively clearing those keybinds.

Now you may refresh your signature on any Guest Journal.
 * Re-signing a Guest Journal updates your signature to the end of the list with today's date (you can still only ever have one signature per character per journal).
 * This allows guests to signal to the homeowner (and to other guests) when the last time was that they saw your home.
 * If you have enabled the "Hide Guest Journals that you have signed" EHT setting, you can still re-sign a guest journal by first summoning it:
   - Mouse over the EHT button

2020-09-29 - 15.7.1

Changed the Housing Hub visit form's house listing to a drop down list to more readily support the growing number of available homes.


2020-09-20 - 15.6.7

Master Writ crafting station markers will now disappear once you have crafted the necessary set item(s).
 * A reminder that Master Writs must be in your inventory - starting the quest will cause the marker to disappear as well.


2020-09-19 - 15.6.6

Fixed an issue that still could have prevented @player names that contained some punctuation characters to fail to sync Community data properly with our server.


2020-09-16 - 15.6.5

Fixed several issues that could have caused markers over certain crafting stations/sets to fail to appear despite having had a Master Writ for that station in your inventory.
 * Please do let us know if you find any further issues where having a certain Master Writ in your inventory fails to cause the floating marker to appear.


2020-09-14 - 15.6.4

You will now be given the option to automatically adjust your game's Video Settings to support the display of FX when placing FX or visiting a home with FX.
 * You will only be prompted when your current Video Settings do not fully support the display of FX.
 * Adjustments made to your settings are temporary. EHT will restore your original settings once you leave the home.
 * You may also choose to have this adjustment done for you automatically every time that you place FX or visit a home with FX.
 * You may enable or disable this feature by changing the "Temporarily adjust video settings when viewing FX" setting found in Settings | Addons | Essential Housing Tools
 * We highly recommend that you set this setting to "Always" to ensure that you can always properly view players FX as well as your own.

Added integration with Tamriel Trade Centre to display the estimated resale value of your furnishings listed in the Housing Hub's Furniture tab.


2020-09-11 - 15.6.1

Fixed an issue that caused EHT's keybinds to be reset to their defaults at every login.


2020-09-09 - 15.6.0

Fixed an issue that could have prevented players with certain special characters in their @name from using the Community app.
 * If you were previously unsuccessful in installing or using the Community app, we encourage you to try the installation process again with this latest version.
 * Thank you to @StabbityDoom and @Lil for first making us aware of this issue.

Fixed an issue that caused the adjustment arrows that appear when Snap to Grid is enabled to move the snapped item in unpredictable directions.
 * Thank you to @Chryseia for first making us aware of this issue.

Fixed an issue that caused the confirmation notification for selecting / deselecting items to sometimes report the incorrect item name.

Added new Points of Interest settings for controling the size and transparency of the floating markers.
Reset the default Points of Interest settings to enable Master Writ station markers, disable non-Item Set station markers and disable color-coded markers.
 * This is a one time reset that should hopefully better suit the majority of players.
Updated the style of Points of Interest markers to be more thematically inline with that of ESO.

 * Select All Items (Except Effects)
 * Select All Items (Except Stations)

Fixed an issue that could cause the EHT button's statistics to fail to update periodically.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Item Preview Pan / Measure controls to fail to appear under certain circumstances.

Added floating markers that will appear above crafting stations in your home as well as other homes that you visit.
 * Toggle markers for non-set stations and/or set stations for which you have a Master Writ in your inventory from EHT's Settings panel.
 * We plan to improve upon this system over the next few updates including support for Master Writ quests.

Added a Fog, Swirling animation effect.

Fixed a Lua error that could appear in rare circumstances when an automatic backup was created upon entering a home that had certain placed FX.

Fixed a Lua error that could appear when attempting to open the "Select" tab, rendering it impossible to use the basic Move features of EHT.


2020-08-24 - 15.4.5

Added three Custom Book effects to the Library category with customisable titles and content (up to ~1,800 characters per book).
 * Thanks to StabbityDoom for the brilliant suggestion.

2020-08-23 - 15.4.4

Fixed an issue that prevented Triggers that restore a Saved Selection from functioning properly.
 * Thank you to Gandalf for identifying the problematic code.

Fixed an issue that prevented some effects from being reverted properly when reverting a selection to the last save.

Improved the speed of restoring a backup, reverting a selection to the last save and playback of some animation scenes.


2020-08-22 - 15.4.3

Clipboard Export and Import now support an unlimited number of items.
 * Due to the game's size restriction on the text box that you copy export data from or paste import data into, Export and Import may now prompt you to copy out/paste your data in multiple parts for clipboards that contain many items. The interface should easily guide you through this process.

Fixed an incorrect error message that would sometimes appear when using the Revert to Last Save feature.
 * Please note that you must still click the "Fix Now" link if any items in the Saved Selection were removed/replaced since the last time you saved the selection. This will allow you to first replace any missing items, after which point you may then Revert to Last Save.
 
 
2020-08-20 - 15.4.2

Added tracking of bound (Crown, achievement, etc.) items vs. unbound items in the Essential Housing Hub via integration with the latest version of DecoTrack.
* Note that you may type the following command in your chat window in order to update your homes' data quickly and automatically (get a coffee while it runs):
  /deco update
Added the age of Open House listings to the Housing Hub and a new sort option for "Newest first" for the Open Houses tab.
Added automatic flagging of inaccessible Open Houses and visual indicators of such homes to spare you from accidentally retrying them.
* Inaccessible homes will now display as "dark" rows in the Open Houses tab and will indicate the last time you attempted to visit the house.
* Successfully traveling to a previously inaccessible home will automatically unflag the home as inaccessible.
Added the option to paste copied items to your current position or to the position from which the items were originally copied.
Added the ability to summon any merchant, banker or other assistant using the Quickslot wheel menu even when the NPC was not already placed in the home.

Fixed an issue that sometimes caused excess Build items to stack far out in the middle of nowhere.
Fixed an issue that prevented the "Statue, Kaalgrontiid's Ascent" from being set to the "Fire" state.

2020-03-07 - 15.1.0

To prevent confusion regarding collectible visibility in the Housing Editor's
Placement and Retrieval tabs, the Essential Filters feature has been changed
to always display collectible furnishings regardless your filter selection.

2020-03-01 - 15.0.8

Fixed an issue that could cause a Restore Backup operation to fail entirely or partially.
Fixed an issue that could cause a Lua error to occur when leaving a player's home that had Calibrated Portal effects.
Removal of Crafting Station Repair feature


2019-11-17 - 15.0.3

Updated the selection bounding box to be significantly more prominent.
* This design change has the goal of preventing scenarios where the Rotation
  arrow buttons might seem to rotate the selected items in a strange way or
  the Bring to Me option might seem to position the selected items far away;
  by making the selection's bounding box significantly more prominent, it
  should be more immediately clear as to why the items rotated or moved in
  a seemingly unexpected way: because there are other item(s) selected
  elsewhere in the home. ;)


2019-11-15 - 15.0.2

Improved the Housing Hub's load times.

Various small fixes.


2019-11-10 - 15.0.1

Fixed an issue that prevented waves from appearing in your wake when passing through water FX.

Fixed an issue that prevented the Crafting Station build templates from working properly while
having the "Stack Excess Build Materials" option enabled.


2019-11-09 - 15.0.0

Fixed an issue that prevented you from being able to set effects' contrast and transparency;
the FX editor's "Contrast" and "Transparency" sliders have now been re-enabled.

Fixed an issue with Sky Overlay FX intersecting with the environment in the
Alinor Townhouse.

Fixed an issue with a number of FX; the updated FX are flagged as "New" to
indicate that a fix was made to them.


2019-11-01 - 14.8.1

Fixed an issue (a "spoopy" issue, as I was told =P) that caused a Lua error to
appear when creating a location-based Trigger.

Fixed an additional issue that caused the "Recolor when in/out of range" Action FX
to affect certain Sky Overlay FX incorrectly.


2019-10-30 - 14.8.0

Finally got time to properly fix the configurable, single volume Library FX...
There is a catch, though.  Unfortuntaely, there was no way for me to properly
migrate your choice of book for your existing single volume Library FX;
but your FX will remain where you had placed them - so all you would need to
do is go back and edit your existing Library FX, choosing the correct book for
each one that you may have placed in your home.

Replaced the Single Volume Library FX with the following new Library FX:
- Any Single Volume, Inset
- Any Single Volume, Intricate
- Any Single Volume, Worn
Each of these Library FX can be customized to "be" any Crafting Motif, Eidetic Memory,
or Shalidor's Library volume from any collection.  Please note that if you have not
completed the Mage's Guild quest line on your character, you will not be able to choose
from the full library of books; once you have, you can choose any book, though you will
still only be able to read books that you have found (to respect the game's core mechanics).

Adjusted several Sky Overlay effects.  Check 'em out.  :)

Renamed the Settings | Addons | Essential Housing Tools | Transfer / Reset setting from
"Transfer Saved Data" to "My @Name Changed" in order to clarify the purpose of the feature.
(It's for transferring your Saved Data from your previous @Name after requesting an @Name change)


2019-10-28 - 14.7.6

Added inventory information from DecoTrack to the tool tips displayed when mousing over items in your Selection
* Requires DecoTrack version 1.7.2 or later [released Oct 24, 2019]

Added a new setting that allows you to enable/disable the on-screen notifications when selecting items
under Settings | Addons | Essential Housing Tools | Notifications & Warnings:
"Display Confirmation of Selection/Deselection"

Fixed several more discolorations that could occur when using the "Recolor when in/out of range" Action FX,
particularly for Sky Overlay FX.


2019-10-25 - 14.7.5

When attempting to visit another player's Open House that is accidentally inaccessible due to
permissions, you will now be given the option to send an automatic notification to the homeowner
to politely make them aware of the issue (if you choose to do so).

Updated the Housing Hub to retain your current scroll position when reloading the current view.


2019-10-22 - 14.7.4

Updated the reference to LibAddonMenu-2.0


2019-10-21 - 14.7.3

Improved the accuracy when targeting and clicking an effect's paint can button to edit or drag it.

- Maelstrom, Apocrypha


2019-10-14 - 14.7.1

Added new Build templates to the Builds tab:
- Scatter (Position)
  This template will randomly distribute your selected items across the specified
  radius (X, Y & Z)
- Scatter (Orientation)
  This template will not move your selected items at all but rather randomly rotate them
  in 360 degrees about all 3 axes.

Fixed an issue that caused FX to fail to assume new colors after placing Glass, Fogged FX.

Fixed an issue that prevented many of the alignment functions from working with FX.


2019-10-12 - 14.7.0

*** NOTE: Players must update to this release to continue to share FX via Chat/Mail/Guilds.
***       Any FX published to the Community will continue to work as is.

Added "Effect Groups," an easy way to apply a single Action effect to an entire group
of effects.  For example:

- Add any effect from the new Actions category, edit the effect, choose "Effect Group 1"
  in the "Target Effect" list and click "Set".

- Add one or more regular effects (anything that is not in the Actions category),
  editing each effect to assign "Effect Group 1" with the new pick list.

Done! All effect(s) assigned to "Effect Group 1" are now affected by one Action effect.

In short... one Action effect can now show/hide, recolor, resize, etc. any number of effects with ease.


2019-10-09 - 14.6.4

Added new Selection Modes to the Select tab:
- By Limit (Traditional)
- By Limit (Special)
- By Limit (Collectible)
- By Limit (Special Collectible)

Added more consistent notifications when adding or removing items from your selection.

Updated the "/sharefx" command to support sharing FX by Chat, Guilds and Mail.
(type /sharefx for instructions)


2019-10-08 - 14.6.2, 14.6.3

Actually, finally, truly fixed the Housing Hub's shyness.

Fixed an issue that caused certain effects to fail to load, such as the "Harvest Node,
Enchanting" - which would subsequently cause the remaining effects to fail to load.
If you were affected by this issue, your effects should be visible once again after
installing this update.

Added new "Action" effects:
- Resize when in range
- Resize when out of range

Added new "Animation" effects:
- Dazzling

Listed the required add-on libraries in the description of Essential Housing Tools
to clarify that Essential Housing Tools cannot run without those other libraries installed.
Placing your cursor over Essential Housing Tools in the game's Addons menu will show
these requirements in the tool tip window that appears.

Added grip handles to the top-left and bottom-left corners of the EHT button's
FX menu and the Options menu to serve as a visual indicator of where to
Click + Hold the Menu in order to drag it into a new location.

The dialog that confirms your registration or removal of an Open House now also indicates
that the home will be listed using the nickname that you have assigned to the home from the
in-game Collections | Housing menu.

Fixed an issue that caused your homes' nicknames to also appear as the nicknames
for some players' homes in the Housing Hub (depending on whether they had assigned
their own nickname). Note that this was a visual error only.


2019-10-06 - 14.6.0

Added a "Cancel" button to the progress bar that is displayed whenever EHT is
busy performing a group move/rotate, copy/paste, etc. allowing you to cancel
the operation and undo the change.

Added new "Action" effects:
- Follow player when in range
- Follow player when out of range

Further improved the generally hideous performance of the "Fireworks, Pinwheel" effect.

Fixed several issues related to the Organize radial menu's options.

Fixed an issue that could have caused some group edits to rotate at unexpected angles.


2019-09-25 - 14.5.6

Fixed an issue that caused "Restore" to fail for some Backups in rare cases.

Fixed a Lua error that could occur when changing Housing Hub tabs while search text
was entered into the bottom search box.

Updated the Add-on's Library references.

Updated the following Libraries to be Optional:
- LibFeedback

Updated the API version supported to include the upcoming release.


2019-09-22 - 14.5.5

Fixed the hideous lag spike that could occur when receiving FX shared via Chat or Guild.


2019-09-21 - 14.5.4

Added the FX count to your homes' Housing Hub entries for those that you have published.


2019-09-21 - 14.5.3

Fixed a compatibility issue with some add-ons, including Dark UI, that would prevent
the 3D Grid from working properly.


2019-09-19 - 14.5.2

Fixed an issue that caused Text FX to disappear when moved or edited.


2019-09-18 - 14.5.1

Many of you have been asking for ways to make your FX even more dynamic for you and your guests...

...even if you can't be home when they come to visit...

Added a new category of "Action" FX, the first of which include:
* Hide while in range
* Hide while out of range
* Recolor while in range
* Recolor while out of range

These new Action FX allow you to choose a target effect to... affect ;) allowing you to do things like:
- Reveal an impenetrable haze that occludes a traveler's vision upon approach of a desert oasis
- Honor those who sit upon a throne with a blazing Light of Meridia that shines with their radiance
- Darken the atmosphere and sky when entering the grounds of a foreboding and ominous castle
- Doors that appear to open themselves to admit your entry
- and much more

Updated the progress bar to display the accurate percent complete when
using the "Place All Items" option from your Inventory screen.


2019-09-14 - 14.4.4, 14.4.5

Added the ability to summon any of the standard crafting stations to your character:
* With the new keybind:
  Controls | Housing HUD | Essential Housing Tools | Summon Craft Workshop
or
* With the new EHT button option:
  EHT button | Summon | Craft Workshop

This new "Craft Workshop" will summon any and all of the following STANDARD stations:
* Alchemy
* Blacksmithing
* Clothing
* Enchanting
* Jewelry
* Provisioning
* Transmute
* Woodworking

Fixed an issue that could cause brief lag when group editing or building a large number
of items while remaining in Housing Editor (F5) mode.


2019-09-11 - 14.4.3

Fixed an issue that could prevent the pasting of a Clipboard in rare instances.


2019-09-10 - 14.4.2

Now you can drag-and-drop selected items to rearrange their order.
* NOTE: Drag-and-drop is only enabled for the "Selected Items Only" View.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Selected Items list to not immediately refresh when
switching the Show option to "Selected Items Only".


2019-09-08 - 14.4.1

Updated the in-world icons that indicate which items are:
* Selected
* In-use by the Builds tab
* In-use by the Scenes tab


2019-09-05 - 14.4.0

Fixed another issue that could sometimes cause the Housing Hub to fail to open on the first
attempt. That was annoying - I agree. :(

Fixed an issue that caused the selected item tooltip to display at an incorrect size when
mousing over an item in the Selected Items list.

Fixed an issue that prevented the X-, Y- and Z-Margin adjustment buttons from working properly
when using the Snap Together feature.

Updated the alerts from EHT's Undo/Redo to display on the screen's center instead of in the
chat window.

Added a new option that prevents the Move/Rotate arrow buttons from auto-fading whenever the
cursor is not hovering over the EHT window:
Settings | Essential Housing Tools | User Interface | Retain Move/Rotate button visibility

Removed the splash and ripple effects left in your wake as you move through the following effects:
* Water, Reflection
* Water, Reflection (Round)
* All other Water and Water-like effects when scaled to be quite small (bucket-sized, for example)

Reworked the collection Library FX to use a new menu for selecting Collections and Books to
read in order to resolve an existing issue that could prevent players from reading collections'
books that were listed on the 3rd page and beyond.

* Ominous Sky
* Thunderstorm
* Maelstrom

Added the following new options to the "Change these items..." drop down on the Select tab:

Fixed an issue that caused a Lua error when right-clicking an item in the Selected Items list.


2019-08-23 - 14.3.2, 14.3.3

Added a new drop down to the Select tab that allows you to choose whether to show:
* Selected Items Only
* All Items from A-Z
* All Items by Distance
  ** This view refreshes the list in real time as you move about.

As a result of the addition of the "Show" drop down described above, Selected Items will
no longer be grouped at the top of the list.  Rather, you may now choose to either see
only the items that you have selected or choose to see all items (which also includes those
that you have selected).

Added a visual confirmation when using the Lock/Unlock button to lock and unlock items.

Extended the workaround for Mac users in order to make effects visible (at the cost of
having to see them through any and all things) until the root issue can be resolved.

Changed the "Reset Selections at Login" option to "Reset Selections at Login/Reload",
allowing you to reset your current selection in all homes any time you login to a new
character OR the user interface is reloaded.

* 14.3.3

Changed the notification shown when attempting to edit an item's position without actually
targeting an item to be more prominent.

Added a new "Minimum Opacity" setting to:

Attention Someone Who Knows Someone Who Has Done The Following Once Or Thrice:
  Do you know someone who has lost an item under the floor?  Behind a wall?  In a bookcase?
  Worse yet - has this happened to that someone while decorating someone else's home?
  I mean, not that you have done this yourself, of course... but "a friend of yours"?

Good News (for that super real friend that everyone else can totally see too):
  The Selected Items list now offers a convenient way to both view and select/deselect any
  items placed anywhere in the home.  Period.  Ellipsis.

How does it work?
  The Selected Items list (found on the "Select" tab) now lists your Selected Items as well
  as all of the other items placed in the house, even if you are not the homeowner.
     ** Decorator permission required.

* Scroll through the list to see both your selected items and all other items placed anywhere.

* Selected items are always grouped at the top of the list, so you can easily see what's selected.

* Left-click any item to select (or deselect) it.  Rejoice.  Repeat.

* Right-click any item to place a marker pin on it for easier identification.

* Mouse Button 4-click anywhere to have Essential Housing Tools do your windows, dishes and
  light floor work.
     ** This feature is still in Beta.

* Your existing Saved Selections work exactly as they had during those darker days... like,
  say... yesterday.  Only they are better, since they are paired with their best compliment:
  all of the other items in your home, ready to be left-clicked and added to those Selections.

Other Natch Potes of debatably equal importance...

Now you may Click + Hold the directional pad (arrow) buttons on the Select tab in order to
continuously move or rotate the selected item(s).
   ** Don't panic - these buttons got a makeover. They're prettier. You should tell them so.

Now the Pitch and Roll directional pad (arrow) buttons will rotate the selected item(s) in the
same manner regardless of the direction that you are facing, provided that you have set the:
 Settings | Addons | Essential Housing Tools | Editing Items | "Directional Editing" option
to
 Relative (this is the default setting)
which means that...
* Pitch will always pitch the selected item(s) forward and backward.
* Roll will always roll the selected item(s) to the left and right.

Updated the Select tab's user interface:
* Labeled the Selection Mode drop down list for clarity.
* Moved the Copy/Paste button beneath the selected item list.
     ** Note: It is still just as important.
* Increased the size of, and added visual feedback to, the directional pad buttons.
* Added the ability to Click + Hold the directional pad buttons to move or rotate
  the selected items continuously.

Improved the visualization of the radius/sphere that identifies the area of effect for
the following effects:
* Brightness, Area
* Colored Room, Meridia's
* Fade To Black
* Fade To White
* Sphere of Silence (All variants)

Added a new setting under Settings | Addons | Essential Housing Tools | User Interface:
* Selected Items List Font Size

Updated the EHT window to become transparent whenever the mouse cursor is not over it
in an effort to improve visibility of your the surroundings. They can be hazardous after all.

Updated to be extra radiant, with 10 times the volume and lasting 5 times longer than
previous updates.  Plus, it's scented.

*14.3.1

Added a notification that is displayed each time an item is selected/deselected via the
Selected Items list.

Updated the Tool Tip displayed for the Selected Items list.

Updated the backdrop color for selected items in the Selected Items list.

[ New Features and Changes ]

effects data by approximately 20%.

Added all Eidetic Memory lorebooks as new Library effects.
* Just add any of these effects - one per Collection - and then edit to select the book
  that it represents from that collection.

Now you can preview the most recent version of your homes' effects that have been published
to the Community - and you can optionally choose to revert to that version if you wish to.
To preview the published version of a home's effects:

* Go to your home
* Mouse over the "EHT" button
* Click the "Essential FX" icon
* Click the "Share" tab
* Click "Preview published version of effects"

While you preview the home's published effects, you can choose two different options in
that EHT FX Share tab:

* Revert to your original effects
  This option will simply revert back to your original effects, just before you began
  the preview.
* Replace your original effects
  This option will replace your original effects with the published version that you
  are previewing.

Note that you may undo the replacement of your original effects by mousing over the EHT
button and choosing the "Undo" action twice.


2019-08-14 - 14.1.6, 14.1.7

  home from your character's inventory.

"Show/Hide FX Paint Cans"

2019-08-08 - 14.1.1

[ New Features and Changes ]

Changed the "Fix Now" function that replaces missing items in a Saved Selection:
Clicking "Fix Now" will now find matching items in either your House or in your Inventory
to replace the missing items (which is what the function has always done) and will also
revert all of the selection's items to their last saved positions.

* This change was made in order to allow players to revert a Saved Selection's items to their
  last saved positions even when some of those items are missing and must first be replaced.

The Trigger Queue window will no longer appear when a trigger activates while the UI is off.

The separate, undocked Progress Bar will no longer appear when a task activates while the UI

Relabeled the tabs along the top of the main EHT window to clarify the purpose of each tab
and to highlight the need to first select items on the "Select" tab as those are the items
which you move, build with, animate and trigger from.

Improved the visual cues provided by the Edit Effect ("Paint Bucket") buttons:

* When targeting an effect's edit button, the paint bucket will now animate to more clearly
  indicate which effect you are target.  This is in addition to the recently added Interaction
  Prompt that displays the effect's type.

* Dynamically sized and colored edit buttons should prove easier to see from vast distances
  and against a wider variety of backdrops.

2019-08-01 - 14.0.1, 14.0.0, 13.9.8

[ New Features and Changes ]

Revised the Essential Effects system to reduce the number of scenarios that could result
in the infamous "invisible boxes" appearing around an effect that is in front of another
effect.

Added a new "Select/Deselect" option to the Organize radial menu, giving players an

* But ideally you would just keybind the "Select / Deselect" function under
  Controls | Housing Editor | Essential Housing Tools

Added new effects:
* Day, Partly Cloudy (Sky Overlays)
* Falling Ash, Heavy (Animations)
* Falling Ash, Light (Animations)

The camera is now prevented from abruptly tilting or panning when using the Organize feature
on a targeted item.


2019-07-27 - 13.9.6

[ New Features and Changes ]

The FX menu got a makeover. The layout stayed the same - but now it feels more confident
and ready to give that presentation to the board at 9am.
* Improved the performance of the FX menu, including load times and general responsiveness.
* Updated the visual look of the FX menu to highlight the tabs and separate the Hide/Show FX
  and Delete All FX buttons.

Added a Search feature to bottom of the FX menu.  Just type a keyword into the box
and press ENTER.  All of the effects listed in the current tab will be filtered.
Clear the box and press ENTER to see all effects again.

Added a notification that should only appear if the installation of Essential Housing Tools
is determined to be incomplete.  This can happen when Minion happens to be right in the middle
of installing add-on updates as you are logging in or reloading the UI - or it can happen when
Minion crashes sometimes.  If you see this message, please do NOT delete your Saved Variables,
but just reinstall the add-on itself and reload the UI.  This should resolve the issue.


2019-07-25 - 13.9.4, 13.9.5, 13.9.51

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added a new setting, "Hide Essential Effects(tm) when the UI is hidden."
* This setting is OFF by default in order to continue to display effects even when the UI is hidden.
  If you experience conflicts with other add-ons when you toggle the UI on and off, toggle this
  setting to ON to disable the custom UI hiding functionality for effects.

Added default behavior for existing and future interactive furniture items that may have
states, such as "Teleport Pad Active" as a random example, that Essential Housing Tools is
not aware of.

Added a new slash command "/acceptmyfx":
* Please, please, please only use "/acceptmyfx" when absolutely necessary.
* Entering "/acceptmyfx" into the chat window and pressing enter will enable or disable this feature.
* When enabled, Essential Housing Tools will accept FX data for YOUR OWN HOMES from any and all players.
* You may use this command in the event that you lose your FX data due to a corrupt or lost saved data file:
  Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\SavedVariables\EssentialHousingTools.lua
* If another player has a copy of your home(s) FX data from before you lost your SavedVariables data,
  you can use this command to allow them to Share your own FX back to you. Doing this WILL OVERWRITE your
  own FX data, erasing any FX you previously placed in that home.
* If you do use this command, please type "/acceptmyfx" again when you have finished in order to disable
  the feature - this will prevent accidental or malicious sharing of your own FX from other players.
* Also, please, please, please for your own sake either use Minion's Backups tab to create regular backups
  of your Saved Variables files and/or make your own manual backups regularly.  I hate to see players lose
  any of their add-on data, but particularly Essential Housing Tools seeing as you can create really complex
  designs, FX, triggers, animations and more - and it would be a shame for any player to lose that work.

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that could cause your character to appear off center while viewing menus such as
the character sheet, inventory or mail.

Fixed an issue that prevented the setting, "Enable Essential Preview(TM)" from working properly.

Improved the accuracy when clicking the paint bucket of an effect to edit it.

Added "Snap To" to the "Organize" radial menu.

  orientation or to make fine adjustments in any direction.

Targeting an effect's Paint Bucket icon while in Housing Editor (F5) mode will now:

  Toggle this OFF to disable the automatic assignment of default keys to unassigned controls.

Added new effects:
* Huge Hanna (Critters and Pets) [Tehauntl]
* Sea Kelp, Forest (Landscaping) [CaffeinatedMayhem]


2019-07-13 - 13.8.3

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added a "Organize" keybind hint that appears on your reticle to call out the Organize feature
to players that are newer to EHT.  This hint will disappear after a few seconds automatically.

The "Select / Deselect" keybind hint that appears on your reticle will now disappear after a
few seconds automatically (even if you enter and remain in Housing Editor mode).

Added smarter item matching when pasting clipboards and restoring backups which should
result in fewer unnecessary "X items missing" warnings and the associated "find replacements"
step that followed.

Restoring a backup will now also create Undo history to allow you to undo any item placements
and/or item moves that were made during the restore process.

The "Fix Now" button used to replace items missing from a Saved Selection, Scene, etc. will
now also create Undo history to allow you to undo any item placements and/or item moves that
were made as part of the replacement process.

Added a significant delay to all batch processes that involve retrieving or placing items
to and from the home in order to cope with the recent server traffic issues.
* This is in addition to the existing safeguards that EHT already has in place,
  which includes requiring server acknowledgement for each retrieval/placement request
  prior to submitting a subsequent request.

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that caused the new "Organize" function to fail when used while holding
an item.  Now, you may either target an item, or pick up an item, and press and hold the
Organize keybind ("O" by default) to Align, Center and Straighten items.


2019-07-12 - 13.8.0, 13.8.1, 13.8.2

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added a new "Organize" function to the Housing Editor...

 To use this new feature, first setup a keybind for it:
  Controls | Housing Editor | Essential Housing Tools | Organize

 Then, while you are in Housing Editor (F5) mode, pickup or target an item
 and PRESS AND HOLD your assigned "Organize" key.
 While holding your "Organize" key, choose an option from the radial menu.
 ( This functions exactly like your Quickslots for using potions, etc. )

 Release your "Organize" key once you have selected the option that you want:
 * Straighten
   Straightens a tilted or skewed item.
 * Align With
   Aligns the item in relation to a second item.
 * Level With
   Levels the bottom of the item in relation to the bottom of a second item.
 * Orient With

   Centers the item in a second item.
 * Center Between
   Centers the item between a second and third item.
 NOTE that most of these options require you to target and click on a second (or even a third) item.

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that resulted from the higher FX Community Publishing limit.  It has been adjusted to

* Nebula (Sky Overlays)
* Tree, Apple (Landscaping)

[ Fixes ]

Fixed issues related to the "Publish house name" option under the "Tools" tab:
* You should no longer run the risk of being logged out for spamming - the tool
  now waits a more reasonable amount of time to complete, rather than allowing you
  to rerun it too quickly.
* The completion message should now accurately report failures only when one or
  more guilds could not be published to as a result of either a lack of permission
  to update your Guild Note or in cases where your Guild Note would exceed the
  maximum size allowed by the server.

Fixed an issue that could record a change in the Undo history after the cancel of
a precision (EasySlide) change.

Fixed an issue that could record a Recent Visit to the Housing Hub when previewing a home.


2019-07-09 - 13.7.3, 13.7.4

[ New Features and Changes ]

Updated the tool tip descriptions of each FX sharing method to reflect the above change.

Added a new "Unpublish from Community" option to the Housing Hub's "Share FX" button.
Use this option to remove a home's FX data from the Community server.
 * Note that players will no longer be able to see your FX unless you republish your home's FX
   or share your FX with players using one of the other FX sharing methods.

Each of your home's entries in the Housing Hub now indicates how long ago you last

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that caused the furniture moves made by Magic Carpet to be recorded as Undo history changes
in Essential Housing Tools.

* Note: You must also update to at least version 3.5.9 of Magic Carpet in order to apply this fix.


2019-07-06 - 13.7.1

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added support for all Item Previews - Guild Stores, Banks, Crown Store, Housing Editor, etc. - for the
Essential Preview(TM) feature, allowing you to pan, tilt, and more accurately measure and compare the
true size of previewed items anywhere you shop or browse furniture.

Added a new "Enable Essential Preview" option to the Essential Housing Tools settings panel's "Quality
of Life" section.

* Toggling this option OFF will disable the Essential Preview feature entirely...
  ...but why would you want to do that?

Added visual confirmation when moving or rotating the selected items using the configurable Keybinds for
North, South, Forward, Backward, etc.

* This is intended as both a visual form of feedback when moving items using the Keybinds as well as a
  reminder to any players who may have inadvertently configured these Keybinds and subsequently may not
  realize why their items are moving.


2019-07-05 - 13.7.0

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added a new reminder to the reticle (crosshair) when you enter Housing Editor (F5) mode for the first time
after logging into the game.  This promptly will briefly display your Select / Deselect keybind (configured
under Controls | Housing Editor | Essential Housing Tools | Select / Deselect).

* This feature is intended to help new players, though you may disable it by toggling OFF the setting:
  Settings | Addons | Essential Housing Tools | Selecting Items | Show Select / Deselect reminder reticle

Renamed the existing effects:

* Wisteria, Vines (Cluster)

* Wisteria, Vines (Trim)
  to
  Wisteria, Vines

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that could cause the movement functions (North/South, Forward/Backward, etc.) to fail to
move a selection of one or more items in a particular direction (based on other, seemingly irrelevant
settings - it's a long story... and not even an interesting one). ;)


2019-07-03 - 13.6.7

[ New Features and Changes ]

Left-click any furniture item in the Housing Hub's Furniture tab to see the item's tooltip information.

the Chat window.


2019-07-02 - 13.6.6

[ New Features and Changes ]

Dramatically improved the performance for operations on a Selection containing linked items:
* Move / Rotate
* Undo / Redo

When Essential Housing Tools detects a new installation that has no data, you will now be
prompted with helpful information about how to access the tutorials and walkthrough videos.

When you change your @player name, the game does not automatically transfer your saved data
from your old @player name to your new one. Essential Housing Tools will now detect this type
of scenario and will offer to transfer your saved data from your old @player name to your new
@player name.
* Alternatively, you may transfer any existing data from a previous @player name to your new
  name at any time by using the new "Transfer Saved Data" option located at the bottom of the
  Essential Housing Tools settings panel.


2019-07-01 - 13.6.5

* Fabric, Quilted (Building Materials)
* Fabric, Quilted (Matte) (Building Materials)
* Fabric, Quilted (Satin) (Building Materials)

Measure furniture items in the Housing Editor's Furniture Browser with greater
accuracy using the new "Measure" button.  Just click the Ruler labeled "Measure"
while previewing any furniture item to see:

- Horizontal and vertical rulers that provide more consistent units with which
  you may compare items or directly measure their dimensions.

  * The scale of these rulers adjusts dynamically from 1m to 4m, depending on
    the size of the item being previewed.

- An accurately sized Tythis the Banker that appears adjacent to the item that
  is being previewed in order to give an additional sense of scale.

- An accurately sized Bookshelf item that appears adjacent to the item that is
  being previewed in order to give an additional sense of scale.

Also, don't forget that the Measure / Pan / Tilt item preview controls can be
moved anywhere you would like - just click and hold the controls to drag them.

The subtitles that display Non-Player Character Essential FX dialogue will
remain visible even if you toggle the UI off for convenience.

Added a new "Suppress notifications when shared to guild" setting for Essential
Effects notifications.  This setting will be ON by default.


2019-06-28 - 13.5.9, 13.6.0, 13.6.1

I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. <3

Fixed an issue that could cause the Housing Hub to fail to open on the first
attempt to open it with the keybind (ALT+H by default).


2019-06-26 - 13.5.8

[ New Features and Changes ]

Compressed the Undo history for all homes in order to reduce the overall
load time as well as to reduce the total size of EHT's primary data file:
.\SavedVariables\EssentialHousingTools.lua

This change yielded a 30% reduction in the size of my personal, heavy use data file;
the net was an approx. 4 second reduction in login/reloadui time.

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that caused a Lua error when toggling FX on or off while
in a home that had no FX.

Fixed an issue that caused homes other than your own to appear in the
House drop down list on the Tools > Reports > Items by House window.

Fixed an issue that prevented you from scrolling through all of your homes
in the House drop down list on the Tools > Reports > Items by House window
for players who own a significant number of homes, use a lower resolution
or use a larger UI scale factor.


2019-06-23 - 13.5.7

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that prevented Essential Housing Tools' Undo/Redo from working for items
that were removed using Essential Housing Tools' "Right-click to put away
from Editor's Retrieve Tab" quality of life feature.

Fixed an issue that could cause the Undo of an item that was put away to place the item
back into the home - but off in a galaxy far, far away. The item would still be accessible
via the Editor's "Retrieve" tab, but needless to say that this was less than ideal. ;)

Removed the following duplicate Painting effects:

* Painting, Fear Frost Depths
	...duplicate of Painting, Fearfangs Cavern

* Painting, Artaeum's Old Vault
	...duplicate of Painting, Ceytarn Keep Grounds

* Painting, Alinor Royal Palace
	...duplicate of Painting, Summerset

* Painting, Torhamekhard
* Painting, Traitor's Vault
* Painting, Nocturnal's Faithful
* Painting, Russafeld
* Painting, Sload Ruins
	...duplicates of Painting, Ceytarn Keep Cave

Please note that if you have placed any of these paintings, they will
continue to work properly; however, you will no longer be able to add
new paintings by that name.  Instead, you would need to add the
corresponding original painting.


2019-06-22 - 13.5.5, 13.5.6

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added new effects:

* Plaster (Building Materials) [Chryseia]
* Wood, Desaturated (Building Materials) [Chryseia]
* Wood, Painted (Building Materials) [Chryseia]
* Velvet (Building Materials) [Chryseia]

These new effects feature two new types of settings:
* Pattern Scale % (X)
* Pattern Scale % (Y)

Adjusting these new settings for these effects will change the size of the
effect's repeating pattern, allowing you to make the tiles smaller or larger
independent of the overall effect's size (covered area).

Updated the Effect Editor to fade in/out when you mouse over it in order to
afford a more clear view of your surroundings.

Moving while the EHT button's context menu is open will now automatically
close the menu in order to better support players using Gamepad mode.

[ Fixes ]

from only selecting items that matched the targeted item.

[ New Features and Changes ]

Updated the antiquated effect of the new Map FX.

Increased the brightness of the Lanterns, Hakoshae (Lit) effect.

[ Fixes ]

select items based on their true center point.  The Radius selection
mode's sphere will now highlight and select/unselect items whose
center point is within the radius of the sphere's visual position.


2019-06-11 - 13.4.6

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added a new effect category:
* Maps

Updated the visuals for the effect:
* Lanterns, Hakoshae (Lit) (Lighting)


2019-06-10 - 13.4.5

the X-, Y-, and Z-axis and labeled the cross sections accordingly.

Added a new Setting that allows you to control the opacity of the Radius
selection sphere.

Added new effects:
* Lanterns, Hakoshae (Lighting)
* Lanterns, Hakoshae (Lit) (Lighting)

[ Fixes ]

Fixed a Lua error that could result from certain types of animated FX.

Fixed an issue that locked the Open Houses tab into Last Visit sort order.


2019-06-09 - 13.4.3, 13.4.4

[ New Features and Changes ]

Reworked the Radius selection modes:
* Use either mode as you always have: enter Housing Editor (F5) mode,
  target an item and press your Group Select keybind.
* After doing so, use your mouse to shrink or expand the selection radius,
  which will be indicated by a sphere that expands with your cursor.
* Once you have set the desired radius, press your Group Select keybind
  a second time.  All of the items within the sphere will be selected or
  unselected.
* As with all selection modes, targeting an item that is already selected
  will instead unselect that item and any other items within your designated
  radius.
* There sphere will be green when you are selecting items;
  otherwise, it will be red when you are unselecting items.

Further enhanced the Radius selection mode:
* Items within the sphere now highlight in a cycle in order to help identify
  exactly which item(s) will be selected or unselected.
* The number of items that are within the sphere is also listed in the
  notification that appears at the bottom of the screen while you are Radius
  selecting.
* Clarified that the "Group Select" keybind should be pressed a second time
  when you are ready to select the items within the sphere.


2019-06-08 - 13.4.2

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added support for Ezabi the Banker and Fezez the Merchant for:
* Summon Storage & Assistants
* Quickslot summoned/dismissed assistants

Updated the Open Houses tab of the Housing Hub to remember its own
sorting, so you can now sort it independently of other tabs.

Updated the default Sort option for the Open Houses tab to be "Last Visit"
order, hopefully making it easier to keep track of which homes you have
(and have not) visited.

Color coded the Housing Hub's "Last Visit" and "FX" dates.

Converted the Housing Hub's "Last Visit" and "FX" dates to relative units,
such as "Last Visit: 3 days, 6 hours ago".


2019-06-08 - 13.4.1

[ New Features and Changes ]

Updated the various Painting Slideshow effects to include these new Paintings.

2019-06-04 - 13.3.2, 13.3.3

[ New Features and Changes ]

Modified the EHT button to display the Shortcuts & Options
context menu when the mouse cursor is placed over the button.
This will only happen when the EHT window and the FX context
menu are not visible. You may still click the EHT button's
"Shortcuts & Options" button to open the menu as well.

Further tightened the maximum item-to-item radius for the
"Connected Items" selection modes.

Added a new effect:
* Maple Leaf (Decorative)

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that made two "Revert to Last Save" operations
required in order to accurately revert a saved selection's items
to their last saved positions.

Fixed an issue that caused Saved Selections to restore improperly
when restored by a Trigger.

Fixed an issue that prevented guests from hearing sounds played
by a host's Scene.


2019-06-03 - 13.3.0, 13.3.1

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added a new effect:
* Antler Coral (Landscaping) [CryHavok101 & StabbityDoom]

Added a significant delay to the /resetdummy command in order to
give the game even more time in between requests; in light of the
recent server load issues, I want to try to mitigate any potential
problems that could arise from the removal / replacement of items.

Tightened the radius of the "Connected Items" selection modes for
better control over which items are selected.

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that prevented the TrueCenter feature from working,
potentially resulting in a shift in the relative position of items
when rotated, pitched or rolled as a group.

Added a new "Heraldry" FX category.

Added a new effect:

This alert will also prompt with the option to automatically assign Limited Visitor
permission to all guests in order to make your Open Houses, well... Open. ;)

Continued the replacement of the game's built-in drop down lists with
the new, custom picklist that scrolls infinitely; you should now be able
to correctly find and select all Saved Builds as well as Selections,
Scenes and Triggers for Trigger Actions.

Enhanced the Radius field that allows you to define the radius of location-
based Triggers to allow for up to 2 decimal places, giving you control of
the hotspot down to the centimeter.

Revised the functionality of the Trigger tab's "Save" button:  Saving an
existing Trigger with a new name will now create a duplicate of the Trigger,
rather than renaming the original.  Please note that you will still receive
an error message if you attempt to overwrite an existing Trigger in this manner.

Added the keybinds that are active while using the EasySlide(tm) precision
placement feature available for customization via the Controls menu under:
Controls > Housing HUD > Essential Housing Tools - EasySlide(TM)

[ New Features and Changes ]

Added a new effect:

* ZuoLiang (Non-Player Characters) [@ZuoLiang]

Changed the drop down list of your Triggers to use a new, multi-line format
that shows each Trigger's description as well as a summary of the Trigger's
conditions and actions. This new format should make it easier to find the
correct Trigger when scrolling through many of them.

Added a secondary map pin icon that will highlight the location of the secondary
item used in dual-condition Triggers that are based on a primary and secondary
items' states.

Improved the accuracy of the visualization of location-based Triggers' hotspots.

[ Fixes ]

Replaced the game's built-in drop down list with a new, custom picklist for
many of the drop down lists in EHT's User Interface.  This new picklist allows
for infinite scrolling, as well as multi-line items, which should eliminate
scenarios where players with large numbers of Triggers, Selections or Scenes
could not scroll through them properly.

Fixed an error that could occur from NPC effects that was introduced in 12.9.5.


2019-05-24 - 12.9.2, 12.9.3

Slightly increased the target radius of the Paint Bucket icons. Targeting and
clicking these Paint Buckets, in order to edit effects, should now be easier.

[ Fixes ]

"Essential Housing Community" add-on was disabled while entering a home
under certain circumstances.


2019-05-22 - 12.9.1

Adjusted the visuals for the "Painting Slideshow, Holographic"
to provide more accurate color reproduction.

Adjusted the behaviour of the "Painting Slideshow, Holographic"
allow for more smooth animation using Scenes; in particular,
the effect no longer resets as a result of being moved.


2019-05-19 - 12.8.5

[ Fixes ]

Fixed an issue that could cause the "Sign Journal" and "Dismiss
Until Next Visit" Guest Journal keybind buttons to duplicate,
linger and wear out their welcome when the guest journal was
opened and closed rapidly...

* You should no longer be stalked by these buttons nor should they
  relentlessly beg for your autograph any longer; You deal with that
  enough already on a daily basis. <3

Fixed an issue that could lead to repeated warning messages
being received from the Essential Housing Community App in
scenarios where the App does not have the necessary security
privileges to register itself to run at Startup.

  allowing guests to sign in separately at each home.

* Please note that guests must have Essential Housing Tools and the
  bundled Community App installed in order to sign your journal.

Added players' Collectible Nicknames for their homes to the
Housing Hub's Open Houses tab.

* Be sure to update your homes' nicknames from the Collectibles
  menu and then re-list your Open House (by clicking the Open House
  button twice, to toggle it Off and back On again).

Going forward, changing the Nickname of any home registered as an
Open House will automatically publish that change to the Community.

Essential Housing Community(tm) BETA is now available

...the first of many upcoming updates that establishes -
and will continue to build upon - the best thing about Housing
in The Elder Scrolls Online...

  The Player Housing Community

Essential Housing Community introduces new, easy-to-use
ways to create, share and interact with fellow members of ESO's
robust and growing Housing Community.

This release adds several Community features:

Publish FX

  With one click, this sharing mode automatically publishes the
  selected home's FX data to the cloud.

  This new Publish button automatically sends your FX data to
  the entire Essential Housing Community of players, allowing them
  to seamlessly receive and view your FX within seconds.

Open Houses

  Invite the Essential Housing Community to visit any of your homes
  with Open Houses.

  To do so, open the Housing Hub (ALT+H by default), open the
  My Homes tab, and click "Open House" next to each home that you
  want to register as Open Houses.  Also, be sure to use the
  game's Housing Editor > Browse > Settings tab to set each home's
  Default Visitor Access to either "Visitor" or "Limited Visitor".

  Once registered as an Open House, your home will appear in the
  Housing Hub's "Open Houses" tab for all members of the
  Essential Housing Community.

What do I have to do to start using the BETA and become a member of
the Essential Housing Community?

 1. For now, you need to play on PC/Windows.
    (Possible Mac client in a future release)

 2. You need to install the new Essential Housing Community app.

	Upon clicking the "Publish to Community" sharing button	for the
	first time on either the FX > Share menu or in the Housing Hub,
	or opening the "Open Houses" tab in the Housing Hub, you will be
	prompted to perform this one-time installation.

    At that prompt, choose to open the <60 second Installation Guide
	video in your browser. This brief video demonstrates the simple,
	easy-to-follow steps to install the app.

    Alternatively, you may install the app in advance if you wish.
	To do so, just follow the steps shown in the Guide video here:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJJdbJB8HVM

 3. Once the app is installed, just restart ESO or type /reloadui
    in the chat window and press Enter.

    You are now ready to publish your FX and host Open Houses with
	the Housing Community with just 1-click - and you are prepared
	for future features as well.

What else is planned?
So much... but to list a few features coming in the near future:

 - Contests
   Taking guild-wide contests to the next level, Essential Housing
   Community will serve as a platform for recurring, server- and
   ESO-wide contests with a variety of categories and rule sets...
   ...and who will be the judge? Everyone.

 - Visitor sign-in
   Maybe once or twice have players asked for visitor sign-in sheets or
   logs in the Forums.  Essential Housing Community's data exchange
   platform will enable this feature (and much more).

 - ...and a ton of other features will be possible, so stay tuned.


2019-05-13 - 12.7.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(tm)

 - Added new effects:

  * Mercenary, Nord (Non-Player Characters) [Volringer]
  * Mercenary, Redguard (Non-Player Characters) [Volringer]

 - Enhanced the furniture search that is integrated with DecoTrack (Version 1.6.6 or later)
   to allow for exclusion of certain words by using a "-" (minus sign) prefix.

 Example:
   replica -dream
 Would find the item:
   Replica Black Soul Gem
 But not the item:
   Replica Dreamshard

 Example:
   estate -surreal
 Would find items in:
   Serenity Falls Estate
 But not in:
   Coldharbour Surreal Estate


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused the Undo of a Placed item to instead move the item
   to a galaxy far, far away, and would require a second Undo to actually remove
   the item back to your inventory.  Undoing an item placement will now spare
   your Undo key needless wear-and-tear by requiring only one keypress. <3


2019-05-13 - 12.7.1

   such as interacting with crafting stations.

 - Fixed an issue that could prevent proper Publishing of FX or Open House
   registration for players with consecutive special characters in their @name.

 - Fixed an issue that could delay or prevent the publishing of Community
   data to the Essential Housing Community server for players that use
   multiple ESO accounts on the same computer.

 - Fixed an issue that could cause Publishing FX to the Community from the
   EHT button's FX menu to ask you if you would like to register the home as
   an Open House even if it was already registered as an Open House.


2019-05-09 - 12.6.7

   next to your Open House entry for all of the Community.

  * Note that you will need to unregister and reregister any existing
    Open Houses that you already have shared with the Community in order
	for your home's custom Nickname to appear.

  * Note that you may edit your homes' nicknames at any time:
    Collectibles menu >
	  Housing Tab >

[ New Features and Changes ]

  * Window, Clockwork (Building Materials) [Divine Design Alliance]

[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(tm)

 - Added new effect(s):

  * Cow, Hereford (Critters and Pets) [Scarlet-Ibis]
  * Cow, Holstein (Critters and Pets) [Scarlet-Ibis]

Essential Effects(tm)

 - Added new effect(s):

  * Sigil, Dark Brotherhood (Sigils and Runes) [Mrs. Norrell]


Utility

 - Added new slash commands:

  /camerazoomin [delay]

  with cinematic smoothness.  Use the optional delay, in seconds,
  to assist with video recordings.

  /camerazoomin 6

  to just over your character's shoulder.

2019-04-28 - 12.5.5


[ New Features and Changes ]

Add-on Support for "Photographer"

 - When the "Photographer" add-on is detected, EHT will no longer
   prevent it from toggling your game's UI on again after capturing
   a screenshot.

 - While the UI is toggled off, EHT will prevent accidental typing
   into the game's chat window.  This should prevent the scenario
   where the game completely locks you out of the chat window and
   prevents you from performing most forms of input until the UI is
   reloaded or the game is terminated (frustrating for me as well).


2019-04-28 - 12.5.4


[ New Features and Changes ]

Utility

 - Summon all of your placed Assistants, Storage Chests and Storage Coffers
   to you with one-click -- and dismiss them back from whence they came 
   with another.  Just use any one of the following:

  * Press the new "Summon Assistants & Storage" keybind (ALT+S by default)
    or
  * Click the new "Bank & Storage" icon found over the EHT button
    or
  * Type /storage

  Doing any of the above a second time restores all of the items to where you
  had placed them originally.


2019-04-27 - 12.5.3


[ New Features and Changes ]

Housing Community

 - Several adjustments to prepare for future updates and features.


2019-04-27 - 12.5.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Copy & Paste

 - Clarified the warning message that indicates when a Clipboard
   cannot be exported as it would exceed the maximum size, including
   instructions to: (1) select fewer items; (2) Copy to Clipboard;
   (3) try the export again.

 - Before exporting a Clipboard, EHT will now simulate the Import of
   that Clipboard Export data in order to validate it.  This will warning
   you of any errors that may be found, preventing any surprises at a later
   time when you try to Import the Clipboard.


2019-04-26 - 12.5.1


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed yet another error message that could appear from the Essential
   Housing Community app. ;)  Sorry for that!  <3

[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an error message that could appear from the Essential Housing
   Community app.

 - Fixed an issue that caused Community-published homes to appear in
   tabs of the Housing Hub where they should not have appeared.

   of the UI while receiving Guild Sharing FX.

  * This tab lists any of the Player Community's Open Houses that
    are available for you to tour.

   Essential Housing Community app directly from the Housing Hub,

   Chat or Guild.

   reload their UI in order to receive your data.


[ Fixes ]

[ New Features and Changes ]

[ New Features and Changes ]

Undo and Redo

 - Reinstated the ability to Undo and Redo changes that involve the
   removal and replacement of Collectible furnishings to and from the
   house.

  * I had removed support for these types of actions many months ago
    as the game would sometimes crash when undoing and/or redoing the
	removal/placement of Collectible furnishings.  This appears to have
	been addressed, so I am reactivating the feature.


2019-04-13 - 12.3.5, 12.3.6

*************************************************************

 VERSION 12.2.0 ADDS A NEW WAY TO SHARE FX WITH ONE OR MORE GUILDS
 SILENTLY AND EFFORTLESSLY.  PLEASE NOTE:

 Players that do not have Essential Housing Tools 12.2.0 or
 later will not receive FX data shared using the new
 Share with Guilds option.

*************************************************************


2019-04-01 - 12.2.0, 12.2.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Share your FX with your entire guild - silently and effortlessly!

  * To share the current home's FX with all members of one of more guilds:

   - Mouse over the EHT button
   - Click the Essential FX button
   - Click Share
   - Click Share with Guilds
   - Select one or more guilds and click Share

  * A few things to note:

   - Sharing with Guilds does not require you to send any chat messages
     and is therefore a more considerate alternative for sharing FX with
	 guilds that have many members that do -not- have Essential Housing Tools
	 installed.  (But why wouldn't you have it installed? :P)

   - As with sharing via Chat, only guild members that are online will
     receive your FX data.

   - You must have permission to edit your Guild Member Note in order to
     use the Share with Guild feature.  If you do not have this
	 permission for a particular guild, please contact the guild's
	 Guild Master or an Officer to request the permission.

   - Share with Guilds operates in the background effortlessly.
     After you select which guild(s) to share with, Essential Housing Tools
	 takes care of the rest -- you will receive a simple confirmation
	 when the process is complete in your Chat Window.

 - PLEASE NOTE:
   Your NPC and Text FX have a 140 character limit.  Any FX that exceed this
   limit will be truncated when shared with other players.  This limit was
   not properly being enforced by the Effect Editor.  I apologize for the
   inconvenience, but any FX that exceed this limit will need to be split
   into two separate FX until I can devise a workaround.

 - FX can be shared for a home with no placed FX to allow you to "clear out"
   any FX that you may have deleted.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that allowed Text and NPC dialog to exceed the maximum
   length of a single FX data message resulting in intermittent errors.


2019-03-31 - 12.1.8, 12.1.9

[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

   it appear more consistent and more vibrant.

EHT Button

   FX data from a player with more than 1000 FX placed in their home.


2019-03-24 - 12.0.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

EasySlide(TM)

 - Now you can Rotate, Pitch and Roll an item while you are sliding it.

 - Now you can Lock onto the currently highlighted Axis by pressing and
   holding the Lock Axis key (shown at the bottom of the screen).

 - Now, sliding an item that's part of your current selection while the
   "Move Items as a Group" checkbox is checked will move all other
   selected items relative to the item that you slid -- just as if you
   had picked the item up and moved it manually.

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added Sky Overlay presets for the following homes:

  * Golden Gryphon Garret
  * Mara's Kiss Public House
  * Saint Delyn Penthouse
  * Sisters of the Sands Apartment


2019-03-23 - 12.0.0, 12.0.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

EasySlide(TM)

 - Added a brand new editing tool designed to help you move items with
   extreme precision -- easily, quickly and intuitively.

  * While you are in Housing Editor (F5) mode, simply Click and Hold an
    item to slide it along any relative axis in a perfectly straight line:

    - Left or Right
	- Backward or Forward
	- Up or Down

  * Easily slide along whichever axis you hold the item nearest to.

  * All 3 axes appear when using EasySlide(tm) and the active axis
    illuminates with 10cm unit measurements to help you guide items
	with extreme precision.

  * EasySlide(tm) can be toggled ON or OFF quickly:
    EHT button > Shortcuts & Options > EasySlide

2019-03-21 - 11.7.9


[ New Features and Changes ]

General

 - Added a new optional keybind to expedite editing:

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added new effect(s):

  * Candle, Single (Decorative)
  * Spider Web, Motionless (Decorative)
  * Spider Web, Billowing (Decorative)

[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Deprecated the Automatic Sharing feature for FX.

  * This feature is no longer supported due to its lack of speed as well as the double work
    required for its maintenance.

    Please continue to use the EHT button > FX menu > Share tab > Share with Chat and 
	Share with Mail features to share your FX.

    Additionally, now you can share your FX as well as any one elses' FX conveniently from
	the new Essential Housing Hub (ALT+H by default), even if you are not in a house at the moment.

  * Light of Meridia (Lighting)
  * Candle, Single (Lighting)

   Type "/roll help" for a list of options.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused the Edit Item Position window to update the Size
   and Color all of selected FX when just one of those values was changed.


2019-03-18 - 11.7.3


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - The FX sharing protocol has changed [once again] -- I apologize.  This change
   is being made in order to reduce the number of subsequent protocol changes that
   may be necessary to support future enhancements planned for the FX system's roadmap.

 - Added new effect(s):

  * Hay, Pile (Decorative)
  * Ship, Schooner (Decorative)
  * Statue, Altmer Archer (Decorative)

[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Now you can move the House / Owner label that is displayed while you are in
   any home that has a custom House Name FX configured.  Just click and hold to
   drag the text to anywhere you'd like -- it will remember wherever you place it.

 - Added new effect(s):

  * Chrispi Chritters, NPC [by Zendyra] (Non-Player Characters)


2019-03-17 - 11.7.0, 11.7.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Shortcuts & Options

 - Now, you can quickly toggle all "toggled" items (such as Lights, Incense, etc.)
   ON or OFF directly from the EHT button's "Shortcuts & Options" menu.

  * Click the EHT button's "Shortcuts & Options" menu, and choose either of the
    options under the "Lights" subheading:

   - Turn All On
   - Turn All Off

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Now you can edit the Size and Color (using the numeric Color values) of one or
   more Effects at the same time.

   To do so, target an Effect and press the "Edit Item Position" key (configured
   in the Controls menu under Housing Editor > Essential Housing Tools) to open
   the Position Item window.  Then, check the "Apply to all selected items" checkbox.

 - Added new Effect(s):

  * Book, Ornate, Clasped, Open [by Chryseia] (Decorative)
  * Parchment, Scroll [by Chryseia] (Decorative)
  * Parchment, Fancy [by Chryseia] (Decorative)

  * Text, Lucida Console (Text)
  * Text, Serif (Text)

 - Moved the following Effect(s):

  * Agrivar, NPC -> Non-Player Characters
  * Zombie Cat, NPC -> Non-Player Characters

 - The Rug, Flying Dragon [by Catsmoke] Effect has been desaturated to allow for
   easier and more accurate dyeing.

Select Tab

 - The "Move Items as a Group" option will now default to "Off" (unchecked)
   and the option will also reset to "Off" any time you zone, relog or reload UI.

  * This option, while very useful for easily moving your selected items together
    as a group by simply moving just one of them, is also a potential stumbling block
	for players	who are new to Essential Housing Tools.

    Many players have accidentally left items selected and then moved one of those items,
	only to find that all of the other items moved along with it. Disabling this
	option by default and resetting it as you travel between homes, or swap characters,
	should reduce or eliminate this scenario.


[ Fixes ]

 - Undo/Redo
   Fixed an issue that caused Undo/Redo to clear the ancillary settings of FX that
   were affected by the Undo/Redo operation, including Portal Calibrations and
   messages configured for Text FX.

 - Backup/Restore
   Fixed an issue that cleared the ancillary settings of FX that were affected by
   a Backup Restore operation, including Portal Calibrations and messages configured
   for Text FX.

 - Fixed an issue that caused the Book, Ornate, Clasped, Open effect to be invisible.

 - Housing Hub
   Fixed an issue that caused the Up/Down arrows to fail to appear for Favorites
   assigned to any player's Primary Home.


2019-03-14 - 11.6.4, 11.6.5


[ New Features and Changes ]

EHT Button

 - The EHT button got a facelift as I work towards unifying and transitioning
   the User Interface elements to align more closely with the FX system's
   design aesthetic and overall ease-of-use.

  * Now, you can access the following just by placing your mouse over the EHT button:
    - Housing Hub
	- Housing Tools (the traditional EHT window)
	- Essential Effects
	- Shortcuts & Options

 - The list of other players' FX that have been shared with you has been permanently
   migrated to the Essential Housing Hub.  The "FX" menu's "Received" tab has
   therefore been deprecated.

  * The "FX" menu's "Received" tab will remain for a period of time and includes an
    explanation of this move.

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added new Effect(s):

  * Zombie Cat, NPC (Player Submissions)
  * Rug, Flying Dragon (Decorative)
    ********************

   (such as a Furniture item of which you have many that are spread across
    multiple characters or homes).

2019-03-14 - 11.6.3

[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that prevented the "Auto-level manually placed "sittable" items"
   feature from working properly when enabled.


2019-03-13 - 11.6.0, 11.6.1, 11.6.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

DecoTrack + Housing Hub

 - Added a new "Furniture" tab to the Housing Hub.

   This new tab integrates directly with DecoTrack to give you a central, easy-to-use
   way to find any and all of your furnishing items.

   To find items, simply type your search into the bottom Search box and press enter.
   The Housing Hub will search DecoTrack's database of all of your furniture items
   and present the results...

   ...and the search is just as flexible as DecoTrack's own, allowing you to search
   for items by:

  * Item Name
  * Item Category
  * House
  * Character
  * Storage Chest or Coffer

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added new effect(s):

  * Custom Home Title (Home Customization)

    Add this effect to give your home a custom title that will be seen
    by anyone that has received your home's FX data.

    NOTE that this title overrides any title that you may have published
    using the EHT > Tools tab > Publish feature.

 - Updated the effect(s):

  * @Cardinal05 (Non-Player Characters)

    Now, you may rename me to you, or to any other name you'd prefer.

Group Editing & Essential Effects(TM)

 - Iterated upon Essential Housing Tools' anti-Gimbal Lock logic in order to
   try to counter the subtle shifts that can result from the system's various
   rounding issues.


[ Fixes ]

 - Cleaned up the Ivy effects' texture to eliminate the thin green floating
   ...string? that ran along the bottom of the Ivy.


2019-03-11 - 11.5.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

	as you come within range of the character (approximately 10 meters).


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused the FX Share tab's "Automatically share your effect"
   check box to always initialize as checked, even when the Automatic sharing feature
   is disabled.

   to be shown in the Chat window upon entering another player's home.

[ New Features and Changes ]

Copy & Paste

   next to any items that were used in the Clipboard which are account-bound or which are

   recipients that may be less experienced with Essential Housing Tools.

2019-03-05 - 11.2.0 & 11.3.0 - 11.3.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - TEXT

  * Yes, Text. Messages, Signs, Inscriptions... It's Text. And it's here. Now.

  * Just click on the EHT button's "FX" menu, click "Add,"
    choose "Text," and select "Text, Courier New."

  * Edit the effect and type a message in the text box. Click "Set."

  * Congratulations... Text. :-) <3

 - CALIBRATED PORTALS have arrived now as well...

  * Just click on the EHT button's "FX" menu, click "Add,"
    choose "Portals," and select "Calibrated Portal."

  * When you edit a "Calibrated Portal" FX, a new section of the Effect Editor
    will be displayed at the top of the editor.  Use this section to:

   - Enter the target homeowner's @Player name
   - Select one of the homeowner's homes or select the Primary Home option

  * When you or any of your guests use this Calibrated Portal, you will be
	transported to the configured home.

  * Note: A generic destination will be displayed for Calibrated Portals that
    are configured to target any player's Primary Home; this is because there
	is currently no way to determine other players' Primary Homes in advance.

 - PASSAGE OF RETURN is another new type of Portal that will instantly
   return you or any of your guests to your home's front entrance.

  * In builds that are primarily centralized around the home's front entrance
    as the "hub" with multiple paths that lead off in different directions,
	such as mazes and other platforming type builds, "Passage of Return" Portals
	offer guests a quick and easy way to link back to the central point -- the
	home's entrance.

  * Note: Passage of Return Portals can also be used as a general nuisance for
    hideously annoying maze dead ends. But I never suggested that, of course...

 - Added new effect(s):

  * Ivy, Typical (Landscaping)
  * The Void (Scenery)
  * Shadowmark, Cache (Decorative)
  * Shadowmark, Danger (Decorative)
  * Shadowmark, Empty (Decorative)

  * Shadowmark, Fence (Decorative)
  * Shadowmark, Guild (Decorative)
  * Shadowmark, Loot (Decorative)
  * Shadowmark, Protected (Decorative)
  * Shadowmark, Safe (Decorative)

 - Changed the following effect(s):

  * All Sceneries
    You may add multiple Scenery effects now, rather than be restricted to only
	one per home.

  * All Portals
    Improved the accuracy of Portal activation regions.

Housing Hub

 - Now you can toggle the Housing Hub with the "/hub" command.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that prevented your Show Housing Hub keybind from also closing
   the Hub if it was already open. Now, you can use the same keybind to both
   open and close the Hub. Sorry - that drove me crazy too.

 - Fixed an exception that would occur when a Cinder Storm FX was placed.

 - Fixed an issue that caused some of the shrubbery-type FX to appear doubled up.

 - Added new effect(s):

  * Water Spout (Animations)


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that rolled back the item state change when processing a
   non-recursive Trigger that changed the state of the same item that was used
   in the primary Trigger condition. Also, can you say that fast 3 times in a row?

 - Fixed an issue that prevented certain recursive Trigger configurations from
   correctly queuing subsequent, valid recursive actions.

 - Fixed an issue that recorded the incorrect source timestamp associated with
   with FX data when shared by a third party.

  * NOTE: You may initially receive "out-of-date" notifications when receiving FX
          shared by a third party for a particular home *until* the first time that
		  you receive the FX data from the actual owner of that home.

		  After receiving the FX data from the actual homeowner for the first time,
		  this message will no longer be displayed for that home unless a third party
		  is genuinely sharing out-of-date FX data.

 - Fixed an incorrect error message that was displayed when using a Portal as a guest.


2019-02-28 & 03-01 - 11.1.1, 11.1.2

  * EHT.Interop.QueueTriggerActions( triggerName [string] ) returns result [EHT.Interop.RESULT]
  * EHT.Interop.IsTriggerQueued( triggerName [string] ) returns isQueued [boolean, nilable], result [EHT.Interop.RESULT]

 - Fixed an issue that caused Primary Homes to function incorrectly in the Housing Hub.

 - Revised the "Plate, Floral (Oval)" and "Plate, Floral (Round)" effects' center regions

Essential Effects(TM)

   Level your items at will!


2019-02-19 - 11.0.0


** PLEASE NOTE:
** Version 11.0.0 leverages an updated FX Sharing protocol in order to facilitate
** the cross-sharing of other players' FX on their behalf.
**
** You must update to the latest version of Essential Housing Tools in order to
** exchange FX data with other players.


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Housing Hub(TM)

 - Added a brand new "Essential Housing Hub(TM)" to the game's main menu
   (the icons that run along the top of the screen whenever you are in a menu)

 - To access the Hub, either click the "Home" icon on the game's top menu bar
   or set up the following keybind:

   Controls > General > Essential Housing Tools > Essential Housing Hub

 - The Hub has several easy-to-use tabs that offer 1-Click access to:

  * Favorites

    A list of your favorite homes which may include homes that you own
	as well as other players' homes (such as guildhalls).

  * Recent

    A list of the homes (your homes and other players' homes) that you
	have visited most recently.

  * My Homes

    A library of the homes that you own.

  * Other Homes

    A library of other players' homes that you have visited or which you have
	had shared with you.

 - Favorite, Visit and even Share FX for any home in the Hub with just 1-Click.

  * Click the "Heart" icon next to any home in the Hub to add or remove it from the Favorites tab.

  * Click the "Visit" button next to any home in the Hub to travel there.

  * Click the "Share FX" button next to any home in the Hub to share the FX for that home via Chat.

    NOTE:  This feature also allows you to share FX data on behalf of another player,
	       provided that their FX data was shared with you. :-)

  * Favorites can be reorganized in any order that you prefer - use any of the 100 slots as you need.

 - Use the fields at the top of the Hub to travel to home owned by any player (that you have access to).

  * Enter any player's @name, then
  * Choose a House, and finally
  * Click "Visit"

 - Use the filter field at the bottom of the Hub to filter the homes displayed in any of the Tabs.


Essential Effects(TM)

 - Revised the Share with Chat and Share with Mail communication protocol.

  ** You must update to the latest version of Essential Housing Tools in order to
  ** exchange FX data with other players.

 - Added several new effects:

  * Arched Panel, Opaque (Building Materials)
  * Arched Panel, Transparent (Building Materials)
  * Moss, Dense (Landscaping)
    ** No relation to Kate.
  * Plate, Floral (Round) (Decorative)
  * Plate, Floral (Oval) (Decorative)
  * Round Panel, Opaque (Building Materials)
  * Round Panel, Transparent (Building Materials)


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused the "Player @name" field on the FX Menu's
   Share tab to become locked if you moved your character while the cursor was
   focused on the text box.  (Say that three times fast...)


2019-02-16 - 10.5.1, 10.5.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Reduced the density of the "Aether Shower" FX to be less ... aggressive
   when covering very large areas.

 - Added a new effect:

  * Sparks (Animations and Weather)

 - Throttled the rate at which FX "Share with Chat" messages are set up for
   you to send to maximum of one message per second.

  * This throttling should prevent unwanted disconnects that could result from
    sending a large number of FX very rapidly.


[ Fixes ]

 - Updated the initial spawn location of the "Sword, Ancient Elven" FX to be
   at the player rather than off in the void - what good would it do there anyway?

 - Fixed an issue that prevented the aetherial rain drops of the "Aether Shower" FX
   from hitting the ground when placed significantly higher than its default spawn location.

 - Fixed an issue that prevented the Effect Editor's "Select" button from visibly
   toggling when clicked.


HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY! <3 :)
2019-02-14 - 10.5.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added a new effect:

  * Aether Shower (Animations and Weather)

 - Added support for FX to the "Change these items..." and "Arrange this build..."
	functions (center, level, axis-align, etc.).

  * Now, you can center, level and axis-align any selected furniture and FX
    relative to other FX.


2019-02-14 - 10.4.9

  * Snowfall, Light (Animations and Weather)
  * Snowfall, Moderate (Animations and Weather)
  * Snowfall, Heavy (Animations and Weather)


2019-02-13 - 10.4.8


[ New Features and Changes ]

   density, particularly when the effect is stretched to cover a large area:

  * Snowfall, Light (Animations and Weather)
  * Snowfall, Moderate (Animations and Weather)
  * Snowfall, Heavy (Animations and Weather)

 - Reduced and standardized the default size of all Water effects.


2019-02-12 - 10.4.7


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added a new effect:

  * Wine Rack (Decorative)

Quality of Life

 - Rolled back the Tilt/Pan change as it seems to be more problematic than helpful. <3


2019-02-12 - 10.4.6


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added a new effect:

  * Cinder Storm (Animations and Weather)

 - Added a throttling mechanism to effect animations that prioritizes the game's
   performance and responsiveness over smooth animations to avoid frame rate
   drops on slower systems or in homes with large numbers of animated effects.

  * This throttling feature should not activate or be noticed for the vast majority of
    systems and specifications unless you have a large number of animated effects or
    particle systems active at once.

Notifications

 - Added an On-Screen notification that indicates when a new Automatic Backup
   is saved.  This will appear when entering a house, or after reloading the user
   interface in a house, that has changed since the last backup was saved.

  * Note that you may disable this notification from:
    Settings > Addons > Essential Housing Tools > Notifications and Warnings [section] >
	 "Backup Notifications"

Quality of Life

 - Added the Essential Tilt/Pan control pad to a number of item and character
   preview scenes (in addition to the Housing Editor's furniture preview scene).

Maintenance

 - Updated the API version number for the companion "Essential Housing Tools Saver"
   data protection addon in advance of the Wrathstone DLC launch.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused all effects to adopt a minimum size constraint, rather than
   a handful of animated effects that would look really strange if made way, way too tiny.

 - Fixed an issue that prevented Triggers from running other Triggers by using the
   Then... "Activate the Trigger" action.


2019-02-11 - 10.4.5


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added a new effect:

  * Weapon Rack, Swords (Decorative)

 - Updated several effects to improve their visual appearance:

  * Dust (Animations and Weather)
  * Faerie Dust (Animations and Weather)
  * Falling Leaves (Animations and Weather)
  * Fireflies, Sporadic (Critters and Pets)
  * Geyser (Animations and Weather)
  * Smoke (Animations and Weather)

 - Moved the "Ground Impact" effect to the "Decorative" category.


[ Fixes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Fixed an issue that caused effects positioned with the Build tab to fail to
   immediately reflect their updated position.

 - Fixed an issue that caused the Automatic Backups, Clipboard, Clipboard Import/Export
   and Copy From Selection dialog windows to appear behind the primary EHT window.


2019-02-06 - 10.4.4


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added several new effects:

  * Energy Beam, Converging (Animations and Weather)
  * Energy Beam, Dissipating (Animations and Weather)
  * Leaves, Falling (Animations and Weather)


2019-02-05 - 10.4.3


[ New Features and Changes ]

User Interface

 - Added a new "Submit feedback, suggestions or a gold contribution" button to the top
   of the Essential Housing Tools main window...
   ...Swankery made me do it and Laura reminded me... again.  ;)

 - Revised the look of the top buttons on the Essential Housing Tools main window:

  * Open Settings
  * Toggle Tutorial Tips
  * Open Video Tutorials in browser

Editing Assistance

 - Added a new setting:
   "Auto-level manually placed "sittable" items"

  * When toggled ON, chairs, sofas and other "sittable" furnishings will automatically be made level
    (parallel to the floor) after you manually place or move them. This aids in placing the furnishing
    in a position that is interactive (green highlight).

    NOTE: Furnishings must still be placed directly on the floor surface or they will remain
    non-interactive (red highlight).

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added several new effects:

  * Door, Orcish (Building Materials)
  * Tree, Snowy (Landscaping)
  * Tree Pair, Snowy (Landscaping)
  * Wrothgar Forest, Dense (Scenery)
  * Wrothgar Forest, Sparse (Scenery)
  * Wrothgar Mountains (Scenery)

 - Renamed the "Craglorn" Scenery effect to "Craglorn Cliffs".

 - Attempting to clone a unique effect such as a Sky Overlay or Scenery will
   display an error message indicating that unique effects may only be replaced
   by adding a new effect of that type.

 - Attempting to add a second unique effect such as a Sky Overlay or Scenery will
   require you to confirm that you want to overwrite the existing effect.


[ Fixes ]

 - Slightly adjusted the clipping of the various "Geode" Decorative effects' textures.


2019-02-05 - 10.4.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added support for the Toggle UI key -- now, when you toggle your UI off,
   your FX will remain visible.


2019-02-04 - 10.4.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added a new "Scenery" effect category that will contain backdrops that can
   completely enclose your entire property.  When added, a Scenery effect will
   initially be set to a default size (based on the preconfigured settings for
   sky overlays); however, Scenery effects CAN be moved and resized to get a
   fit that suits your build.

  * A new "Craglorn" effect has been added to the Scenery category.

 - Added a new effect:

  * Window, Redguard (Building Materials)

User Interface

 - Updated the 3D icon that indicates the center/starting point of your current
   build parameters to be more relevant.

 - Updated the 3D icon that identifies a selected item when left clicked, a trigger
   item when used as a condition, and an adjacent item when snapping items together.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused the "Colored Panel, Sturdy", "Color Panel, Thin"
   and "Rainbow" FX to appear opaque, rather than semi-transparent, when shared with guests.

 - Set the FX orientation precision to 0.1 degree to match the precision of shared FX data,
   ensuring that all FX appear the same to the homeowner and to guests.

 - Fixed an issue that prevented the group selection of an effect immediately after
   its placement.

 - Fixed an issue that prevented the dragging of an effect immediately after its placement.

 - Fixed an issue that caused the 3D Snap-to-Grid arrows (used for minor adjustments after
   snapping an item to the grid) to remain visible (and stationary) when performing a
   subsequent Undo or Redo operation.


2019-02-02 - 10.4.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Revised the Share with Chat and Share with Mail data formats to fix potential
   precision errors that could cause FX that are very, very tightly aligned with
   another object, such as a Painting FX against a wall, to appear incorrectly.

   *** THIS DATA FORMAT CHANGE WILL REQUIRE THAT YOU AND YOUR GUESTS ***
   *** BOTH UPGRADE TO THE LATEST VERSION OF ESSENTIAL HOUSING TOOLS ***
       <3 <3 <3

 - Added several new effects:

  * Column, Ayleid
  * Door, Carved Ayleid
  * Water, Reflection (Round)  :-P


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that could have caused furnishings placed by the homeowner after
   having entered their home to be unselectable with EHT.  EHT will now refresh the
   furniture cache more aggressively while in another player's home.


2019-02-01 - 10.3.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Triggers

 - Added future support for the Update 21 API change allowing for the querying of
   group members' X-, Y- and Z-axis positions.

  * Starting with Update 21, location-based Triggers will now only fire within their
    radius in every direction for you and for group members - as opposed to today,
	where group members fire triggers by walking over the trigger spot at any elevation.

 - Added future support for the 4 unique states of the Update 21 item, "Hlaalu Salt Lamp."

  * Starting with Update 21, use the "On," "On (2nd)," and "On (3rd)" options to condition
    based upon the lamp's 3 unique On states, as well as the 4th Off state.
	...who said you can't have form AND function?

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Iterated upon the depth ordering ("clipping") algorithm once more.

  * The latest implementation should now properly order all effects that are at least
    somewhat facing the camera; intersecting effects will continue to be problematic
	as I believe that this is something that may be unsolvable with my limited access
	to the game's core engine / rendering pipeline via LUA code.

 - Added a unique constraint to the "Darkness, Veil" effect - a single instance of this
   effects can darken the entire home a little all the way to Vanta Black by adjusting
   its gray scale color slider from left to right.


[ Fixes ]

 - Stitched up the ever so slightly, only sometimes-ish visible seams between the
   sky overlays' panels - after breaking several needles and running out of thread.

 - Fixed an issue that caused certain location-based triggers to continuously show
   a notification regarding the criteria being met.

 - Fixed an issue that caused particles emitted by effects such as "Faerie Dust" to
   briefly appear with a visible outline during particle initialization.


2019-01-30 - 10.3.0, 10.3.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added a "Received" tab to the EHT button's "FX" menu.

  * This new tab lists the players' homes that you have received FX data for
    via chat or mail. Going forward, updates to this list will also indicate
	the relative age of the data (i.e. "2 hours ago", etc.).

  * Left-clicking any home in the list will automatically teleport you to that
    player's home, provided that you have sufficient permission.

 - Added "Select" / "Deselect" buttons to the Effect Editor panel.
   Use these buttons to add or remove that effect to or from your current Selection,
   particularly in scenarios where you cannot target and select the effect.
   (For example, when an effect is behind a furniture item)

 - Adjusted the following effects:

  * Colored Room, Meridia's
    The color balance of this effect has been adjusted to allow for more accurate
	color tinting as well as much deeper lightening/darkening of the area.

  * Glow Worms
    Adjusted the intensity of the worms' glow.  They are much more glowy now.

  * Painting Slideshow, Crossfade
  * Painting Slideshow, Holographic
    Adjusted these effects to randomize their starting painting.


[ Fixes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Fixed an issue that caused the Painting Slideshow effects to display improperly.


2019-01-28 - 10.2.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Share with Mail

  * Now you can share your Essential Effects(tm) with other players using the game's Mail system,
    even when the other player is not online.  To share with mail:

	1. Open the EHT button's FX menu.
	2. Open the Share tab.
	3. Enter the player's @name and click "Send with Mail".

	Essential Housing Tools will send the FX data using one or more in-game mail messages,
	depending on the number of effects you have placed in the home.

	When the receiving player signs in and checks their mail, Essential Housing Tools will
	automatically process and remove the FX mail messages, as well as notify the player
	of your shared effects (if the recipient has enabled FX Notifications).
	
	As with Share with Chat, the FX data that you share with other players is a point-in-time
	snapshot of your Essential Effects(tm) set up.  Any subsequent changes made would require
	that you share your FX data again in order to update other players.

 - Added several new effects;

  * Brightness, Global (Lighting)
  * Glow Worms (Critters and Pets)
  * Time Rift, Neutralized (Animations and Weather)
  * Time Rift, Unstable (Animations and Weather)

 - Adjusted the following effects:

  * Fireflies, Sporadic (Critters and Pets)
    Increased the number of active fireflies in proportion to the total area of the effect.

  * Portal, Ayleid (Building Materials)
    Players' screens will now white out nearly completely just as they pass through the portal,
	helping to create the illusion of "teleporting" for builds that incorporate completely
	different environments on either side of the portal.

  * Wisp of the Shadow Runner (Animations and Weather)
    Replaced this effect with the new Time Rift, Unstable effect.

 - Fixed an issue that caused the Video Settings > Subsampling Quality warning to display
   after each login.  The warning will now only display once.

Tools

 - Enabled the Repair Crafting Stations feature as well as the auto-repair feature
   that automatically repairs your crafting stations whenever you port into a home
   that you own.  After a period of several weeks of personal testing as well as
   with input from other players, I have concluded that:

  * Crafting stations most definitely continue to suffer from the periodic inaccessibility
    issue when porting into your home - something that is definitely NOT a result of
    anything EHT is or was doing (as evidenced by the issue still occuring after disabling
    the repair feature); and,

  * I am tired of having to fix my own crafting stations each time I port into my
    primary just to make a point about EHT not being the root cause. ;-) So, for those who
    have been asking me when I will renable this feature - here ya go. <3


2019-01-24 - 10.1.3


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added several new effects

  * Faerie Dust (Animations and Weather)
  * Ivy, Dense (Landscaping)
  * Portal, Ayleid (Building Materials)
  * Windows, Imperial (Building Materials)

 - Added depth layers to all shrubbery effects to enhance better simulate 3D.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that prevented a phrase-activated trigger from running when
   you whispered the phrase to another player.


2019-01-24 - 10.1.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added several new effects:

  * Fireflies, Sporadic (Critters and Pets)
  * Stone Pillar, Spiked (Building Materials)

2019-01-23 - 10.1.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

   for the "clipping" (depth ordering) algorithm with respect to small particle
   effects, such as Bubbles.

 - Added several new effects:

  * Door, Nedic
  * Boulder, Cliff Face


2019-01-23 - 10.1.0


NOTE:
This version changes the FX "Share with Chat" format.
If other players do not see your FX properly, please ask them to update to the latest release.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused Player Submitted FX to appear as the incorrect effect type
   when shared with Chat.


2019-01-23 - 10.0.4


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Further revised the "clipping" (depth ordering) algorithm in an effort to
   reduce the angles/perspectives that can cause avoidable clipping of one
   effect behind/through another.  A quick note on this:

  * Due to the system's limitations, you will still need to avoid having
    two or more effects directly intersect with one another in order to
	fully avoid the clipping issue.

 - Added several new effects:

  * Bubbles, Falling (Animations and Weather)
  * Door, Imperial (Building Materials)
  * Target (Decorative)
  * The Hand (Decorative)
  * Tree, Withered (Landscaping)


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that prevented the Undo/Redo of the removal of some collectible furnishings.
 - Fixed an issue that turned what was once a very happy pumpkin patch quite Elphaba green.


2019-01-21 - 10.0.3


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added several new effects:

  * Books, Horizontal Stack

  * Arch, Ayleid (Building Materials)

  * Geode, Ruby (Decorative)
  * Geode, Sapphire (Decorative)
  * Instrument, Harp (Decorative)
  * Instrument, Mandolin (Decorative)
  * Water Lilies and Pads (Landscaping)


2019-01-19 - 10.0.0 - 10.0.1


[ Known Issues ]

 - Effects cannot currently be "Rolled;" however, you can adjust their Yaw and Pitch.

 - The indicator that orbits an Effect while editing it has been
   temporarily removed to eliminate the flickering that it would
   often cause.  A new indicator will be added back in an upcoming patch.


[ New Features and Changes ]

What the FX...?  Effects are now [essentially] Furniture!

  All of Essential Housing Tools' suite of features now support Effects,
  meaning that your effects can now be:

  * Moved, rotated, aligned and centered as a group with Selections
  * Saved, loaded and restored with Selections
  * Locked and unlocked
  * Cut, copied and pasted
  * Undo and redo changes
  * Backed up and restored
  * Constructed with Builds

  * Arch, Ornate (Building Materials)
  * Ceiling, Vaulted (Building Materials)
  * Ceiling, Barrel Vaulted (Building Materials)

  * Masonry, Framed (Building Materials)
  * Pumpkins, Cluster (Landscaping)
  * Rope, Braided (Decorative)
  * Stone Blocks, Sectional (Building Materials)
  * Stone Blocks, Weathered (Building Materials)

 - The FX menu and the main EHT window are two bad mofo's who will not
   share the stage.  As such, opening one will close the other to avoid
   any unwanted confrontation.

Automatic Backups

 - Increased the maximum number of furniture and effect backups retained to 5 per house.


[ Fixes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Flattened the shrubbery Landscaping FX to avoid clipping
   (popping in and out) of the darker, rear texture panel.

 - Fixed an issue that caused the homes listed on the "Copy From Saved Selection"
   window to include other players' homes as well.  The list will now only show
   homes that you own.

 - Fixed an issue that caused some FX to become cropped when scaled to be smaller than their default size.


2019-01-12 - 9.6.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Separated the setting that toggles the notification when receiving shared Effects
   into 2 different settings; one for the On Screen Display message and one for the Chat message.

     On Screen Display notifications, you will need to toggle the new setting as well.

   * Water, Swift Current (Round) (Landscaping)
   * Water, Rapids (Round) (Landscaping)

   ** Please note that, to be able to create round Water effects, the overall color of the
      water with "Currents" had to change very slightly in order to make the textures match.

	  You should verify that the color of your "Water, ... Current" effects and
	  make any necessary minor adjustments.

   such that, when pasted, the group of items would reconstruct elsewhere in the house.


2018-12-30 - 9.4.4


[ New Features and Changes ]

Group Editing

 - Moving a group of items using the Directional Arrows while in Absolute mode
   (North/South/East/West) will now move relative to your 3D Grid.

   * Now, when you Adjust the Grid to align with a home (in homes that are not
     perfectly aligned with the compass' North/South), the Directional Arrows
	 will move items along the lines of your adjusted Grid rather than absolute
	 North/South/East/West.

	 This feature is only applicable to "Absolute" positioning mode (set from Settings).

Essential Effects(TM)

 - If you have Adjusted the Grid to align with the current house and then
   add Effects to the home, the new Effects will start rotated to align
   with the Adjusted Grid (the direction closest to the direction that your
   camera is facing).  This should make it more convenient for starting new
   Effects facing the most likely desired direction for homes that you
   Adjusted the Grid for.

 - Added a new Effect:

   Building Materials
   * Brick

 - Increased the animation speed and slightly increased transparency of the following Effects:

   a reduction of the clipping that plagued the previous version.

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Adjusted the automatic positioning of the various Sky effects for:

   * Pariah's Pinnacle


2018-12-29 - 9.4.1

[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added new Effects:

   * Painting Slideshow, Holographic
     ...3D glasses not required. ;)

   * Glass, Stained

 - The "Painting Slideshow, Crossfade" Effect just shed a few extra millimeters
   to allow it to be set flush within the inset of painting frames.


2018-12-28 - 9.3.9


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added a new "Building Materials" Effect:

   * Metal, Sheet

 - Added a toggle to the Effect Editor window that allows you to switch between:
 
   * Fwd / Back (Relative) Positioning
     In this mode, the Position arrows will move the Effect relative to the direction
	 that you are facing.

   * N-S-E-W (Cardinal) Positioning
     In this mode, the Position arrows will move the Effect North, South, East or West.

	 Note:
	 If you use Adjust the 3D Grid for the home (from the Gears icon on the EHT button)
	 to orient the grid to a different North/South heading - which is incredibly useful
	 for the many homes that are not oriented directly with North/South on the Compass -
	 then this mode will actually move the Effect along your customized North/South lines.

 - Now you will no longer see other players' EHT FX chat message data;
   instead, you will simply see a confirmation message in your chat window plus
   the optional On-Screen Display notification (which can be disabled via Settings).


2018-12-27 - 9.3.8

     items to prevent them from intersecting with one another.


[ Fixes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Fixed an issue that caused the Fireworks and Sparkles effects to display abnormally large particles.

   * Water, Gentle Current
   * Water, Mild Current
   * Water, Swift Current
   * Water, Rapids

 - Reworked the textures and added mist rising from the base of the Effect:

   * Waterfall

   with group members upon their arrival.  From the EHT button, click
   "Special Effects," then click the "Share" tab and toggle the option:
   "Automatically share your effects with group members"

   * As you can share your Effects with multiple people - even your entire
     guild - from the Special Effects "Share" tab by using the "Share with Chat" button,
	 you may prefer to disable the original "automatic group sharing" method with this toggle.
	 (But feel free to use the slower but automatic group method as well!) ;)

     Upon entering the area within the Effect's radius, the entire environment
	 is colored with the hue of your choosing.
   * Colored Panels
     Set up dividers, wall coverings, ceilings and more with an assortment of

 - Now you can cycle through Effects from the Effect Editor. To do so, just edit any
   Effect and then use the Left and Right arrows at the top of the Effect Editor to

     close together within a small space.

2018-12-16 - 9.0.2 - 9.0.3

 - Dramatically improved the collision/clipping issues associated with several of the Effect Types.

 - Improved the initial placement of the various Fog effects as well as their densities.

v9.0.2

 - Added new Essential Effects(TM), including a variety of Fog types as well as several new Sigils.
   * ...and don't forget that you can stretch and color any of these effects for even more customized looks.

 - Added a new "Clone" button to the Effect Editor controls.
   * Clicking "Clone" will create an exact duplicate of the Effect you are currently editing,
	 placing it directly on top of the original Effect.  The Effect Editor will automatically
	 begin editing the new, duplicate Effect, so you can then quickly change it however you'd like.

 - Adjusted the brightness and visibility of all of the Enchantment Effects (Glyphs, Gates and Sigils)
   to allow for higher contrast in a greater variety of lighting and backdrop configurations.

 - You can now set any of the Enchantment Effects (Sigils) to a solid black color.

 - After clicking an Effect's Paint icon to edit it, the icon will now remain visible and pulsate
   in order to show where the Effect's center point is as you move/edit it.

[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

 - Added a new environmental (sky) effect: Aurora Borealis, Midnight


2018-12-12 - 9.0.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Essential Effects(TM)

The Essential Effects(TM) feature is no longer in Beta!

 - A library of over 55 special effects, environmental customizations and weather effects
   is now available for you to experiment with and use in your homes!

 - The "FX" list, adjacent to the existing "EHT" button, now displays the available effects
   in a scrolling list format (scroll with the Slider bar or with your mouse's Scroll Wheel),
   which better accommodates the rapidly growing list of effects.

 - The Effect Editor now shows the name of the effect being edited for clarity and it
   has also been made semi-transparent for better visibility while using it.

 - The "Here" standard icon on the Effect Editor does just that - it brings the effect to you.

 - Performance has been improved quite significantly for many of the particle effects.

A few more things...

 - The feedback from the community has been incredibly helpful (as always!) and I have a
   comprehensive list of features that I will be working on that will continue to enhance
   Essential Effects(TM) as well as streamline the Effects Editor even further.
   You should see a list of these planned features from me soon. :)

 - As of today, the Beta period has allowed me to stabilize the Essential Effects(TM)
   sharing protocol, allowing you to more reliably share your home's effects with any
   visiting guests that have Essential Housing Tools and who are in your group.

 - There are a few known issues at this point in time:

   * Opening the World Map while in a home with Essential Effects(TM) will show
     Error dialogs.  I am working to resolve this issue which will be released in a future
	 patch.

   * Some of the effects' visuals can sometimes partially or compeltely clip or hide the
     visuals of other nearby effects.  This clipping has improved considerably from when
	 this feature first entered Beta, but it still remains an issue.  If you experience
	 this, my recommendation is to try elevating or simply relocating one of the conflicting
	 effects.  I will continue to work to improve or resolve this issue, if it is in fact
	 possible to do so.

 - If you experience any other issues not listed above, please report the issue to me
   either via the ESO Forums (@R_K) in a Discussion Thread (preferred) or via Direct Message.

 - And one more thing... you are all so, so helpful, courteous and very talented.
   Please... never change. <3

      rather large number of add-ons that can cause conflicts with the original, map ping-based protocol.

2018-11-17 - Version 8.1.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

3D Grid

 - You can now automatically snap items to any 3D Grid intersection (on any axis and even the item's rotation).
   Use the "EHT" button's new Quick Access Grid Settings (explained below) to toggle Snap to Grid on.
     * With Snap to Grid Horizontal and/or Vertical, items that you place or edit
       will automatically snap to the nearest intersection on the Grid.
       * You can snap any of these parts of an item to any Grid intersection:
         - Center of the Item
         - Top or Bottom of the Item
         - Left, Right, Front or Back Face of the Item (including Top-Left, Bottom-Right, etc.)
       * Items snap automatically using the Item Face (or Item Center) that is nearest to a Grid intersection.
     * When Snap to Grid Rotation is toggled on, any item that you pick up and move will automatically orient
       itself relative to the Grid's rotation.
       * If you are working in a house that is not oriented in a perfectly North/South or
         East/West direction, be sure to use the Adjust Grid option to rotate your 3D Grid
		 to match the home's orientation.  After doing so, you can Snap items to automatically turn to face
         correctly relative to that Grid set up.

 - After snapping an item to the Grid, you can adjust the item's position and rotation using the 3D arrows.
   * You must use Cursor Mode to click these adjustment arrows.
   * You may hold SHIFT+Click or CTRL+Click to make position adjustments in larger increments.

 - You can now quickly access Grid-related and Selection-related settings right from the "EHT" button.
   Just place your cursor over the button to toggle:
     Grid Lines
     * Grid Lines (Horizontal and Vertical)
     * Grid Lock (to hold the grid in its current position)
     * Grid Adjustments (to pan, scale and rotate the grid)
     Snap to Grid
     * Horizontal Snap-to-Grid

     You can Copy & Paste each individual page of the report into a separate file to submit as an attachment to any Support Case you send to ZeniMax.
	 The report purposely includes the unique Database ID number of every item on record in Essential Housing Tools to give Support a very detailed view of the items you had at that point-in-time.


[ Fixes ]

2018-10-19 - Version 7.9.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Guidelines and LaserLevel(tm) system
 - Added two brand new systems to aid in manual furniture editing and alignment:
   * Guidelines
   * LaserLevel(tm)

Guidelines System
 - This system provides a 3D grid while in Housing Editor mode that can be used to align items manually with better precision.
 - The grid will automatically follow your character while in selection mode.
 - Whenever you are in placement mode while editing an *already placed* item, the grid will shift underneath the item being edited.
 - You may toggle Guidelines and the associated LaserLevel(tm) system off at any time using the new "Guidelines" toggle button at the bottom of the main window.
 - Click the "crosshair" button next to the "Guidelines" toggle to access the Guidelines Adjustment On-Screen Display.
   * Using the Guidelines Adjustment OSD, you may realign the grid as well as increase or decrease the size.

LaserLevel(tm) System
 - This new system provides a series of laser guides that extend well beyond the bounding box of an item while you are editing it.
   * These laser guides extend in all four cardinal directions from the item's top and bottom corners and mid-sections.
   * Using these guides, alignment of an item relative to other items can be achieved with a greater degree of precision.
   * The laser guides follow basic physics, disappearing against hard surfaces, allowing you to better judge from a distance where the item aligns to other items, walls, floors and more.
 - This system may be disabled independently of the Guidelines system under Settings.

Selection Indicators
 - Added new "Indicators" and "Group Box" toggle buttons at the bottom of the main Essential Housing Tools window that offer quick access to enable/disable these 3D visual indicators.
 - Changed the rotating checkmark that indicates a selected item to rotate slightly faster and to cycle through a wider variety of colors.
   * This was done to improve visibility against more furnishing types and materials.
 - Changed the rotating checkmark to scale relative to size of the item that is selected.
   * This was done to improve visibility on large furniture items; small items should demonstrate no change.
 - Changed the individual line segments of the group selection box to roll over continuously.
   * This was done to improve visibility from any angle.
 - Changed the group selection box to scale relative to the volume of the group selection.
   * This was done to improve visibility when selecting many items, large items, or items that are dispersed over a large area.


[ Fixes ]

User Interface
 - Fixed an issue that caused a number of drop down boxes to remain visible using the main window's top, right "Minimize" toggle button.


2018-10-16 - Version 7.8.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Selection & Editing
 - Further tweaked the Gimbal Lock avoidance algorithm. (You're welcome, @Eclaveth)
 - Masked the Gimbal Lock avoidance adjustment value in the Edit Item Position dialog for those who cannot bear to see their otherwise flawlessly round, integer degrees marred by a 0.02 degree offset (including myself). :)

Builds
 - Added a new Build Template: "Wave"
   * This template can be used to construct a Sinewave.
   * Use the "Elliptical" option to independently adjust the X-Radius (Frequency) and Z-Radius (Amplitude) of the wave.
 - Positioned the "Circumference" build option just under the "Space items automatically based on Item Count" checkbox option for Build Templates that use these options.
   * This was done for clarity as you can now immediately see the single option that is enabled (Circumference) for those Build Templates when you check the auto-spacing option.
 - Renamed the "Build an Ellipse" build option to "Elliptical" as this option is now shared by both the "Circle" and "Wave" Build Templates.


2018-10-15 - Version 7.8.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Selection & Editing

 - Added a new selection mode, "Linked Children Only," that selects ALL child items linked to the parent item that you target.
 - Added new "Link Group" and "Unlink Group" options to the "Change these items..." drop down on the Select tab.
   * These options will automatically link or unlink all of the items in your current selection using the upcoming parent-child linking feature.
   * The "Link Group" function will link a maximum of 49 children to a single parent item;
     Groups that exceed 50 items will be linked in a list, with the parent of each group of 49 (or fewer) children linked as a child of the previous parent.
     ** This will allow you to very quickly link hundreds of items together so that they can be edited or animated as if they were a single item.  Amaze.
   * At the launch of Murkmire, the new Link Items feature will provide extremely efficient editing and animation options.
     ** Explanatory and demonstration videos to come...  More Amaze.

Builds
 - Added "Auto Spacing" option to the "Cylinder" build template.
 - Added "Circumference (# items)" option to the "Cylinder" build template, available when you select "Auto Spacing".

[ New Features and Changes ]

Scenes
 - Now you can add a new dimension to your scenes: Sound!
   * A sound effect can be added to any Frame in your Scene.
   * Use the "Add a sound effect to this frame..." drop down to select a sound effect for the current Frame.
   * The selected sound effect will play during the Scene's playback at that Frame.
   * You may choose to have no sound effect or one sound effect for any given Frame; multiple sounds for a single Frame are not supported at this time.
   * Sound effects are only played on your computer at this time.
     ** ...and yes, I am asking ZeniMax for the API changes that would be necessary to support initiating sound playback for other players in your home.
	    :-)

EHT Button
 - Rebadged the EHT Button to better coordinate with the new Magic Carpet Button.
   * it's pretty imho
 - Wrapped the EHT Button in double-sided tape to make it [literally] 10x easier to drag-and-drop.
   * If you still don't like where the button was, you really, really should be able to drag it wherever you'd like now. Pinky swear.


[ Fixes ]

Builds
 - Removed an unnecessary item that was used for building the bottom line of the letter "D".

Edit Item Position Window
 - Fixed the Anti-Gimbal Lock logic.
   * Any Pitch that is a multiple of 90 degrees will automatically be offset by a fraction of a degree.
   * This feature aims to avoid the dreaded "item flipping" issue that occurs when using a Pitch of 90 degrees.


2018-10-10 - Version 7.6.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Scenes
 - Added a new "Loop frames if necessary to match Scene lengths" option for the "Change this Scene..." drop down's "Merge with another Scene" feature.

   * Thank you, Tobbe!
 - Relabeled the default option for the Then... result "The items in the Saved Selection" selection drop down to:
   "- Do not use a saved selection -"

[ Fixes ]

[ New Features and Changes ]

Builds
 - Added a new "Text" Build template that allows you to construct written text using virtually any type of item.
   * Just be sure to use the *same* item type in your selection - mixing and matching is not recommended.
   * You may build text that spans multiple lines - hit enter in the Message box to start a 2nd, 3rd, etc. line.
   * Text is left-aligned for multi-line messages.
   * Support for lowercase will be added in a future update.
 - Added tooltips to the Build tab's category headings.

Copy & Paste
 - Exported clipboards no longer include each items' link in the itemized list at the top; the item name and quantity is still included.
   * This was done to resolve an issue that prevented the export of Clipboards that contained many different types of items.

Editing
 - Updated group arrangement and per item arrangement functions to use the new TrueCenter(tm) calculations for more accurate positioning even when working with off-center items.
 - Updated the "Bring to Me" arrangement function to center the item(s) directly on the player's character.
   * Be prepared to "Travel to Entrance" if you bring large items on top of yourself.  :-P
     (But at least it will be accurate for placement!)
 - Renamed the "Match Target's Orientation" arrangement function to "Orient Each Item with Target's Orientation" for clarity.
 - Updated the "Stack in a ..." arrangement functions so that separate piles of items are spaced far enough apart such that it is easy to then Select "Connected" to grab individual groups for convenience.

User Interface
 - Moved the main window's Standard Item Count and Population Count above the window, at the top-left corner.
   * Added a setting under the "Quality of Life" section, "Show Item Count and Population," that can show or hide these statistics from the main window.

   * Publishing for a different house will unpublish any previously published nickname.
   * Publishing will only work for guilds that grant you access to edit your Guild Member Note.


2018-09-21 - Version 6.8.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Builds
 - Added a new shape template: Pyramid


2018-09-20 - Version 6.8.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Copy & Paste
 - Added a new "Paste from Selection" button.
   * Use this button to paste the Clipboard's layout to your currently selected item(s).
   * This should afford a greater degree of control over which item(s) are used in the Paste operation than the "Paste from House Items" button.
 - Relabeled the "Paste to House Items" to "Paste from House Items" for consistency/Eclaveth.


[ Fixes ]

Copy & Paste
 - Fixed an issue that could prevent pasting Crown-purchased Clipboard items from non-Crown items and vice versa.


2018-09-20 - Version 6.8.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Editing
 - Added a new "Reset Each Item's Orientation" option to the "Change these items..." drop down.
   * This will reset all of your selected items' orientations to 0 degrees Pitch, Yaw and Roll.
 - TrueCenter(tm) single item rotation correction is no longer in Beta and is now enabled by default.
   * You may still disable this [life saving] feature [if you really, really want to?] under Settings > Editing Items.

Builds
 - Added a new shape template: Cone
 - Added support for entering negative degrees for Build parameters that require an angle.
 - Added a new "Stack Excess Build Materials" Setting under the Editing Items section.
   * When enabled, selected items that are unused by your Build will be stacked off to the side to reduce clutter.


2018-09-19 - Version 6.7.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Arrangement, Layout, Sorting and Interactions
 - Renamed the "Arrange these items..." drop down to "Change these items...".
 - Moved the Turn Lights "On" and "Off" options into the new "Change these items..." drop down.
 - Added new options for Grouping and Alternating the selected items by Name (in ascending or descending order).
   * You can use these Grouping and Alternating options to Build floors, walls and more with varying patterns of items of similar sizes, such as a roof with alternating dark and light blocks.

Group Editing
 - Adjusted the smallest setting for the "Changes" slider to use increments of 0.1 degrees for rotations, up from 0.02 degrees.
 - Moved the Turn Lights "On" and "Off" options into the new "Change these items..." drop down.

Scenes
 - Added a notification at the top of the window that briefly confirms when a Frame is saved.

Triggers

   * You must have Decorator permissions in order to create Triggers in other players' homes.


2018-09-17 - Version 6.6.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Copy & Paste
 - Now you can copy both Collectible Furnishings to the Clipboard.
   * Please note that, due to a game crashing bug in the game's API, Collectible Furnishings will not be Pasted from inventory;
     However, you will be able to paste Collectible Furnishings using the "Paste to House Items" button provided that you place the Collectibles in the house first.


2018-09-16 - Version 6.6.1


[ Fixes ]

Selections
 - Fixed an issue that prevented Selections from being saved.


2018-09-16 - Version 6.6.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Builds
 - Migrated the "Wall" template from Immaculate Construction into Essential Housing Tools.
 - Migrated the "Floor" template from Immaculate Construction into Essential Housing Tools.
 - Reworked the "Cube" template to produce a hollow, top- and bottom-less (4-faced) Cube shape.
   * This was done to bring the template more in line with what many players reported having expected from a template named "Cube." (And I agree) :)
 - Renamed the "Rectangle" template to "Rectangle (Outline)".
 - Renamed the "Rectangle (Filled)" template to "Rectangle".
   * These two rename changes were made to clarify the purposes of the two different templates as well as to
     make [the new] "Rectangle" template the "go to" choice given that it is often times the most likely
	 template that players new to Essential Housing Tools will want to use.


2018-09-15 - Version 6.5.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Triggers
 - Added a new option for Trigger's "Then..." actions, "Activate the Trigger".
   * Using this drop down, you can designate a Trigger to activate when this Trigger's action(s) finish running.

Automatic Backups
 - Added an explanation of the Backups feature to the Backup Created confirmation message.
   * It now explains that backups may not be retained indefinitely as a result of the 3 Backups per House cap.
   * It also explains how to create a more permanent backup using a Saved Selection.


[ Fixes ]

Group Editing
 - Fixed an issue that prevented the new Keybinds for Rotate Clockwise and Rotate Counterclockwise from working when using the Edit Item Position window.

Automatic Backups
 - Fixed an issue that could cause the list of saved backups to sometimes not refresh.


2018-09-13 - Version 6.4.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Group Editing
 - Added a new Beta feature, TrueCenter(tm), that is disabled by default but which you can enable from Settings under:
     Settings > Addons > Essential Housing Tools > Editing Items > Enable TrueCenter(tm) Beta
   * When enabled, any single item selection can be rotated with the Directional Pads (Pitch, Yaw and Roll)
     about the item's true center point rather than the often times arbitrary 'center' point designated by the system.

Selections
 - Selecting an item now immediately runs the Measure Item Dimensions process to calculate the item's dimensions (to assess the TrueCenter(tm) of the item).
   * Item dimensions are cached automatically to reduce the frequency that this process must run.
   * By calculating the TrueCenter(tm) of items, Essential Housing Tools can now automatically rotate items around their actual center point in more functions, resulting a in happier Housing Experience. :)
 - Added a new "/resetdim" command that will clear your Item Dimensions cache in the event that invalid dimensions become saved to the cache.


2018-09-13 - Version 6.3.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Item Editing HUD
 - The X, Y and Z dimensions of the Bounding Box for the item you are moving now shows in the Item Editing HUD.

Group Editing
 - Split the "Align with Target X-, Y- or Z-Axis" functions in the "Arrange these items..." drop down into two separate sets of functions:
   * "Align Group with Target X-, Y- or Z-Axis"
     ** This will align the entire group, from the group's center, to the target's axis.
   * "Align Each Item with Target X-, Y- or Z-Axis"
     ** This will align each individual item, from its center, to the target's axis.
 - Dramatically improved the accuracy of many of the "Arrange these items..." and "Arrange this build..." functions for items that have an off-center center.
   * You know, those pain in the butt items that never rotate around their actual center.

Scenes
 - Scene Recording now shows a persistent notification at the top of the EHT window.
 - The current Scene Frame # now shows as a brief notification at the top of the EHT window whenever moving between Frames.

Triggers
 - Activated triggers now show their name as a temporary notification at the top of the EHT window.
   * This should help with troubleshooting complex orchestrations of triggers.
 - Queued trigger actions will now only interrupt the currently running Trigger's Scene playback if that Scene is Looped (you saved the Scene with "Loop" checked).


[ Fixes ]

Group Editing
 - The Arrange functions' "Select a target item..." prompt will now return you to Housing Editor mode if you were already in Housing Editor mode when you started the Arrange process.


2018-09-12 - Version 6.2.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Scenes
 - Scenes now record and playback the On/Off state of scene items that can be toggled.
   * New Scenes created with Essential Housing Tools v6.2.0 and later will record and playback item state automatically.
   * Old Scenes created before Essential Housing Tools v6.2.0 can be updated to record and playback item state by previewing the individual Scene Frames and clicking "Save Frame" for each one.
     ** Note, if you do this process, this would be the ideal time to also change the state of items in the Scene at key frames - but you may also go back and change item states in individual frames and re-save those frames at a later time if you wish.
 - Added a new Popup Tip to explain the new capabilities of Scene recording and playback.

Triggers
 - Reduced the opacity of the visual "hot spot" indicator shown while editing Location-based triggers to allow players to still see through the circular area.


2018-09-11 - Version 6.1.1


[ Fixes ]

User Interface
 - Redesigned the Tab buttons to be more defined and to scale appropriately when using higher resolutions or the Microsoft Windows text enlargement display options.


2018-09-10 - Version 6.1.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Edit Selection
 - Added an even more precise setting to the "Changes" slider at the bottom of the window.
   * Now, the Smallest change setting will move your selected items in increments of 1 centimeter and rotate in units of 0.02 degrees.
   * This Smallest change setting should make it easier to make near imperceptible changes to items' pitch, yaw or roll in order to correct the dreaded flickering that can occur between overlapping items.
 - Added new Keybinds (configurable under Controls) to explicitly Increase or Decrease the move speed (precision).
   * This compliments the existing Toggle Move Speed that cycles between all 6 speeds, allowing you to instead explicitly increase or decrease the speed as needed.
 - Added a new "Directional Controls focus on Position Editor's Item" setting.
   * When toggled ON, the Directional Controls (move selected items Forward, North, Up, Down, etc.) will only move the item being edited with the Position Editor pop-up window whenever it is open.
   * When toggled OFF, the Directional Controls will continue to move all selected items, regardless of whether the Edit Item Position pop-up window is being used or not.

Builds
 - Dramatically reduced the cooldown for each "Auto-Build" to begin so that making adjustments and moving the build's position feels more responsize.

Settings
 - Revised the Custom Rotation Precision to accept more decimal places to allow for greater... precision?


[ Fixes ]

Edit Selection
 - Fixed an issue that could cause the selected items to be moved a significant distance from your character when using the "Bring To Me" arrangement option.

Builds
 - Fixed an issue that could cause a Build's "Measure Items" batch process to be skipped when clicking "Reset" or "Measure", resulting in unevenly spaced items.
   * Now, when you click Reset or Measure, it will reset the build or measure the items' dimensions after any currently running batch process completes.
 - Fixed an issue that could cause the build to be moved a significant distance from your character when clicking "Reset Build" or using the "Bring To Me" arrangement option.


2018-09-10 - Version 6.0.2

[ Fixes ]

House Transporation
 - Removed formatting tags that would appear incorrectly on some clients.


2018-09-09 - Version 6.0.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Copy & Paste
 - Clipboards can be pasted using items already placed in the home now!
   * To do so, it is best to stack the necessary items neatly in the home, preferably away from any decorated portions of the house.
   * Then, stand directly on or next to the pile of items.
   * Finally, use the Copy & Paste > Paste to House Items button to "paste" the clipboards' item layout using the matching items that are closest to you.
 - Clipboard Exports now include instructions that explain how to import and paste the clipboard data.
 - Clipboard Exports now include an itemized list of furnishings that are necessary to fully paste the clipboard into a home.
 - When copying a group of items and then pasting the group, the new items will be pasted directly adjacent to the original group if you are within 20m of the original group.
   * The new group will be adjacent in the dominant cardinal direction in which you are standing in relation to the original group.
   * This is to make it easier to clone a group of items and then position it perfectly in relation to the originals.

Item Arrangement
 - Added the "Mirror" function back in for a certain EHT Power User whose name is definitely not Eclaveth.
   BUT... just a heads up - the function is in the "Arrange these items" drop down and is now called:
   * Flip Group on X-Axis
   * Flip Group on Y-Axis
   * Flip Group on Z-Axis
   * :-)
 - Split the "Level with Target" Arrangement option into two new options:
   * "Level Each Item with Target" which levels each individual item in the selection with the target item.
   * "Level Group with Target" which levels the entire group of items with the target item.


2018-09-08 - Version 5.9.92


[ New Features and Changes ]

Triggers
 - Item State-based Triggers that do not allow reactivation while running will now reset an item that was toggled more than once during the Triggers execution.

 - Fixed an issue that caused some Triggers to fire continuously while meeting their conditional criteria.


2018-09-07 - Version 5.9.9

 - Removed incomplete Chat Message-related code.  Sorry for any weird echoing of messages!


2018-09-07 - Version 5.9.8


[ New Features and Changes ]

Group Editing
 - Added a new "Essential Housing Tools - Move Selected Items" section under Controls that allows you to set up Keybinds for moving your selected items.
   * These optional Keybinds provide fast access to the following Directional Pad edit buttons:
     - Move Forward / North
	 - Move Backward / South
	 - Move Left / West
	 - Move Right / East
	 - Move Up
	 - Move Down
	 - Rotate Clockwise
	 - Rotate Counterclockwise
	 - Toggle Edit Speed (Cycles from Small through Large changes, one increment at a time)

 - Added a persistent notification at the top of the window whenever Triggers are disabled (via the "Disable Triggers" checkbox on the Triggers tab) as a reminder.


[ Fixes ]

Selections
 - Fixed the tool tip for the "Changes" slider at the bottom of the window.
   * The units of measure now read "centimeter increments" or "meter increments" when appropriate instead of always showing "meter increments".


2018-09-07 - Version 5.9.7


[ New Features and Changes ]

Selections
 - Added a new selection mode drop down option, "All Stations".
 - Added a new selection mode drop down option, "All Stations (Same Set As Target)".
   * These two new selection modes should expedite any project that involves designing layouts for attuned crafting stations.

Builds
 - Added a new build template "Crafting Stations (Rows)".
   * This build template arranges craftion stations by set, in rows that are sorted alphabetically, with all stations facing the same direction.
   * As with the "Crafting Stations (Pods)" build template, you may change the Item Yaw to 180 degrees to flip all of the stations to face the opposite direction.
   * As with the "Crafting Stations (Pods)" build template, you may use the Directional Pads to rotate the entire layout in whatever direction suits your house.
 - Renamed the previous build template "Crafting Stations" to "Crafting Stations (Pods)".


[ Fixes ]

Builds
 - Fixed an issue that caused the build template "Crafting Stations (Pods)" to lay crafting stations out in a bizarre pattern, rather than a NxN square of sets' stations in pods.


2018-09-06 - Version 5.9.6

 - Added a new slash command, "/listfavhouses".
   * You may use "/listfavhouses" to list the Favorite Houses that you can set up.
 - Added a new Keybind section under Controls > General > Essential Housing Tools - Favorite Houses
   * You may configure a Keybind to quickly jump to your character's Home.
   * You may configure up to 10 Keybinds to quickly jump to your first 10 Favorite Houses.

2018-09-05 - Version 5.9.5


[ New Features and Changes ]

   * In cases where only some items are available to be pasted, a warning message and prompt will request your approval to continue with a partial Paste operation.
 - Removed several back-to-back confirmation dialog windows to expedite certain application functions, such as Copy Selection and Cut Selection.
   (You're welcome, Daileth. :P)

Scenes

   * You may use "/playscene" to play the current Scene.
   * You may use "/playscene scene" to play a specific Scene by name. For example:
     /playscene Tornado
 - Added a new slash command, "/stopscene".
 - Added a new slash command, "/rewindscene".
   * Note that this will rewind the currently loaded Scene.
     If you are playing a Scene by name that is not the currently loaded Scene -
	 "/playscene SomeOtherScene" for example - then playback of that Scene will stop;
	 the currently loaded Scene will then rewind and begin to play.

Selections
 - Added the item type (Traditional Furnishing, Special Furnishing, Collectible Furnishing or Special Collectible)
   to the Item Placement HUD, along with the number of that type of item already placed and the maximum allowed for the house.

Triggers
 - Added a new Trigger Condition option If "You enter combat" ...
 - Added a new Trigger Condition option If "You leave combat" ...

Selections
 - Added a new warning message that appears when you have selected items that are far away from each other.
   * This is to help prevent scenarios where:
     - You may forget to click "New" to clear your selection before selecting a new group of items to then move/copy/etc.
     - You may forget or not realize that you have clicked select "All Items" before moving the whole group (which would shift your whole house around obviously).

Tools
 - Added a new "Reset All Dummies" button that will reset all of the Target Dummies in your house to full health.

General
 - Added a new /resetdummy command that will reset all of the Target Dummies in your house to full health.

2018-09-01 - Version 5.9.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

Triggers
 - Added a new Trigger option "Allow reactivation while running."

     For example, when a guest toggles a Switch multiple times in a row before allowing the Trigger to finish running.

General
 - Updated the /house command to also support jumping to another player's house.
   * To jump to a player's primary house, just use:
     /house @name

2018-08-30 - Version 5.9.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

Housing Editor Mode
 - Added a new Item Placement HUD display for all sorts of information that any perfectionist would appreciate while moving items:
   * Position (X, Y, Z)
   * Orientation (Pitch, Yaw, Roll)
 - Added support for DecoTrack integration into the new Item Placement HUD display in order to include inventory counts of the item being placed, such as:
   * # in current house
   * # in other house(s)
   * # on other character(s)
   * # in storage coffer(s) and chest(s)
   * # in bank
 - The new HUD and optional DecoTrack integration are both enabled by default; these can be disabled from the Settings panel by turning off:
   * Selecting Items > Show Item Placement HUD
   * Selecting Items > Include DecoTrack Data in Item Placement HUD
 - Please note that you will want to update DecoTrack to its latest version, if installed, to ensure interoperability between both addons now and going forward.


[ Fixes ]

Select Tab
 - Finally found a way to prevent the camera from jumping when you:
  * Group select/deselect an item
  * Open the Edit Item Position window

Build Tab
 - Added a new "Randomize" button that randomly changes various build parameters.
  * The Randomize button acts as a toggle, serving to create a "slideshow" effect of successive builds until clicked a second time to toggle the generator back off.

Scenes Tab
 - Added audible cues for the "Save Frame" and "Save & Insert New Frame" keybinds.


2018-08-28 - Version 5.8.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

Scenes Tab
 - Added a new "Preview" checkbox.
   * (Default) When ON, scrubbing through the Scene's Frames will "show" the Frame (the items will move to their saved positions for that Frame).
   * When OFF, scrubbing through the Scene's Frames will NOT "show" the Frame (the items will not be moved to their saved positions for that Frame).
   ** This feature allows you to copy a Frame from several Frames back into the current Frame.

[ New Features and Changes ]

Scenes Tab
 - Added a new "Center On Me" button that repositions the Scene, centering it on your character.

   * The cloned Scene will be placed with your character at the center, so it's helpful to stand where you want the Scene to be prior to clicking Clone.
 - Cleaned up the User Interface with minor labeling and spacing changes.


2018-08-27 - Version 5.7.6

 - Added a new /house command.
   * Just type /house followed by the full or partial name (or your own nickname) for the house and you will automatically teleport there.

Scenes Tab
 - Modified Scene Playback to move up to 10 items instantly in a single frame, deferring the 100 millisecond delay per item until after the 10 item moves or until the end of the frame.
   * This should make for smoother playback for Scenes that move 2 to 10 items per frame, while still remaining within the server-imposed limit of 10 item moves per second.

Editing Directional Pads
 - Modified Group Editing of Items to move up to 10 items instantly in a single frame, deferring the 100 millisecond delay per item until after the 10 item moves or until the end of the frame.
   * This should make for less choppy group editing, while still remaining within the server-imposed limit of 10 item moves per second.
 - This new batched item editing functionality is enabled by default; it can be disabled under Settings > Enable SmoothMotion(tm).

2018-08-17 - Version 5.4.1

[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added a new Trigger condition, If "You use a specific item from a Quickslot," which allows you to activate a Trigger by using any item from any Quickslot.
   * Note that the item must be used from the Quickslot - add-ons that expand your Quickslots beyond the standard 8 radial wheel slots are not supported.
 - Added a new Arrange option, "Bring to Me," which does just that -- it brings the selected items right in front of you.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused all Tutorial Tips to be shown when clicking the "Show tutorial tips for this tab" button, instead of just those tips that are relevant to the current tab.


2018-08-16 - Version 5.3.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Automatic Backups! Now, each of the homes that you own will be automatically backed up whenever you enter the house (if anything has changed since the last backup).
 - Open the Undo tab and click "Automatic Backups" to:
  * View the list of dates/times that each automatic backup was saved (for whichever house you are currently in).
  * Restore a backup, including placing any items removed since the backup into the house as well as moving all items to where they were at the time of the backup.
  * Create a new backup manually, if you wish to do so.
 - Note that the backup system is currently capped at the 3 most recent backups per house; older backups are automatically discarded. - I may increase this limit in a future release.
 - While on the "Build" tab, a 3D visual indicator will now show where the center or base of your build is within the house. Changes to the build's X, Y and Z axis will also shift this indicator in an effort to clearly show where your build is at all times.
 - While Snapping furniture items together, a 3D visual indicator will now show which adjacent item you are currently snapping to.
 - Tutorial tips have been added for the "Undo" tab.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue where some UI elements would not refresh when porting to a different house.


2018-08-14 - Version 5.2.0

 - Fixed an issue where you could be logged out for too many messages when toggling all lights on/off in a house with approximately 400+ interactive items.


2018-08-13 - Version 5.1.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Tutorial pop-up tips are finally arriving. These tips are enabled by default and will appear the first time you visit each tab that has tips associated with it.
 - Future updates will include additional Tutorial tips that will cover the Tabs that did not get any love this update, as well as explain any relevant changes.
 - Scene frames now require you to click the "Save Frame" button in order to commit any changes made to the frame's furnishings. This was done in order to support the following change.
 - Changes made to furnishings during Scene playback will not be logged in the Undo history - meaning that you still will not be able to "Undo" changes made during playback;
   However, one Undo history entry will be saved for any furnishings that are used in a Scene prior to Scene playback (whether that playback is one frame at a time, or playing the entire Scene from start to finish).
 - The Minimize Window button (top-right of the window) will now cycle between the following window sizes:
   * Tabs and directional controls (Full window)
   * Directional controls only
   * Tabs only
   * Minimized (Title bar only)
   This new functionality makes it easier to focus on the task at hand, whether that be positioning a group of items (Directional controls), editing an animation Scene's frames (Tabs only, "Scenes" tab), etc.
 - Renamed the "Contiguous" selection mode to "Connected".
 - Renamed the "Contiguous (Same As Target)" selection mode to "Connected (Same As Target)".


[ Fixes ]

 - Undo History will be updated prior to Scene playback to allow you to Undo changes made to the Scene's items during playback.
  (Undo History line items are still NOT generated for each Frame played back as this would overload the Undo History unnecessarily)


2018-08-10 - Version 5.0.1


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added a "Delete Scene" button the "Scene" tab's "Load Scene" dialog.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused the current waypoint to be repeatedly reset while editing a Trigger that used a location-based condition.


2018-08-10 - Version 5.0.0


[ If This, Then That ]

 Home Automation is here!

 Build a Smart Home...
  Build a Haunted House...
   Build a Scripted Roleplaying Event...
    Build a Retro 70s Dance Floor...
     Build a Guild Conference Room that opens up at the flip of a switch...
      Whatever you do, just please post photos or video of your machinations for us to enjoy! :)

 All Home Automation is powered from the new "Triggers" tab.  Give it a try with these steps for creating your first trigger:

 1. On the "Select" tab, click "Select All", type "All Lights" for the Selection Name and click "Save".
    (You can also now click "Clear" to unselect all of your items so you don't forget later)

 2. On the "Triggers" tab, click "New".
 
 3. Type "My first trigger" for the Trigger Description.
    (or something meaningful, like "Turn All Lights ON")

 4. For the Condition ("If ..."):
   - Choose the Condition type, "An interactive furniture item is changed".
   - Click "Select An Item..." and Target and Left Click on one of your Lights, Switches, Incense or other interactive, toggled items.
     -- A 3D pointer will indicate the selected item.
   - Choose the "On" option.

 5. For the Actions ("Then ..."):
   - Under "The items in the Saved Selection", choose your "All Lights" Saved Selection (that you created in Step 1).
   - Choose the "On" option.

 6. Click "Save".
    Test your new Trigger to make sure that, when you turn "On" the item that you selected in Step 4, all of your other lights also turn "On".
	Note how you could also make a second Trigger that would allow the same item, when turned "Off", to turn all of your lights "Off".

 7. Rinse & Repeat to create combinations of various Triggers that automate your house in fun, weird or utterly unique ways.
    (...and please explore the other options that Triggers have to offer -- you really can do a lot with a little, I promise!)
 
 8. Invite your friends over to impress, shock, ...scare?, and amaze them with your new interactive home. :)


[ Additional New Features and Changes ]

 ** NEW **
 < Tools Tab >

 - Added a new "Tools" tab that contains a number of useful, one-click functions:
  -- Click "Repair Stations" to repair any *correctly placed* crafting stations that become inaccessible when zoning in/out of the house.
  -- Click "Turn all items On" to turn "ON" all interactive items that can be toggled.
  -- Click "Turn all items Off" to turn "OFF" all interactive items that can be toggled.
  -- Click "Toggle all items" to toggle all interactive items that can be toggled to their next state.

 < Select Tab >

 - Overhauled the "Select" tab to use a new, streamlined layout that offers:
   -- One-click to load a saved selection using the saved selection dropdown list at the top of the window.
   -- One-click of an item in the selected items list will show a 3D pointer to that item.
   -- One-click to turn all interactive items in your selection ON or OFF.  Just select one or more lights, switches, incense, etc. and click the Turn all lights "ON" or "OFF" button.
   -- Easily revert all items in a saved selection to their last saved positions.
 - Moved Copy & Paste functions, as well as the Clipboard tab, into the new Clipboard window.
   -- You can copy, paste and view the clipboard's items by clicking the "Copy & Paste" button on the "Select" tab.

 < Build Tab >

 - Added a new "Disc" Build Template for building flat, circular disc shapes.
 - Adjusted the arrangement of armors sets' stations for the "Crafting Stations" Build Template. Stations are now organized into aisles with each armor set having 2 stations facing the other 2 stations.
 - Removed the pop-up notification dialog that prompted you to relocate your Build to your current position.  The "Bring to Me" button will now highlight in red with an accompanying tool tip in these circumstances.

 < General >

 - The Minimize button (top-left of the window) now toggles the window between minimized, full view and a new "edit controls only" view that shows only the directional pads and related functions.
 - Cleaned up many of the user interface elements.
   * Button labels are no longer enclosed in angle brackets [ ]. Instead, buttons now appear as light blue links.
   * Layout is consistent across multiple tabs - more changes are coming in a future update to bring even more uniformity.


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that caused the name of the current Selection to reset to "New Selection" when switching between tabs or closing and reopening the EHT window.


2018-07-24 - Version 4.2.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added a "Crafting Stations" shape template to the Build tab.
 * This template will build pods of (up to) 4 stations per armor set.
   Use the Item Spacing section to control the distance between pods or to make it easier to group select individual pods for manual placement.

 - Added a "Layout items in checker pattern" option to the Build tab's "Dome" and "Sphere" shape templates.


[ Fixes ]

 - Revised the Gimbal Lock correction to leave 0 degree angles untouched.


2018-07-20 - Version 4.1.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added Margin adjustment controls to the Snap Furniture palette.  Now, you can nudge the snapped item a little to the left or a little up or down to get a perfect snap.
 
 - Redesigned the Snap Furniture palette's interface.

 - Added caching to the Measure Furniture Dimensions process to help speed up the Furniture Snapping process.


2018-07-19 - Version 4.0.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Adjusted the placement of new Builds as well as the placement of a current Build when "Bring to Me" or "Reset Build" is clicked. Your shape will be reconstructed in front of your character.

 - SNAPPING! Yes, Snap an item to adjacent items easily with the new Snap Furniture feature.

   Before getting started, first assign a keybind for:
     Controls > Essential Housing Tools > Snap Furniture Items

 === How Furniture Snapping Works ===

 * While in House Editor mode, simply target an item and press the Snap Furniture Items keybind (configured under Controls > Essential Housing Tools > Snap Furniture Items).
   If there are touching (or nearly touching) items, the Snap Furniture palette will appear.

 * Using the palette, you can cycle through the various edges that the two items can be snapped together along.

 * If there are multiple adjacent items, you can also cycle through those items using the palette to ensure that the correct two items are snapped together.

 Note that you may adjust how far away adjacent items can be by changing Settings > Addons > Essential Housing Tools > Furniture Snapping Radius.


2018-07-07 - Version 3.9.3


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed a long-standing UI Error that could occur when resizing the game's window or when swapping between the game and the Window's or Mac desktop.


2018-07-06 - Version 3.9.2


[ Fixes ]

 - Added the "Circumference" parameter back to the Spiral build template -- it was slightly useful.


2018-07-06 - Version 3.9.1


[ Fixes ]

 - Fixed an issue that could cause some of the add-on's windows to hide when they should not hide.  These windows are no longer quite so shy.


2018-07-06 - Version 3.9.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added a "Space items automatically based on Item Count" checkbox to the Build tab for many shape templates.
   Example: Check this option to automatically size a Circle to fit all of the items in your selection, spaced evenly.
   Example: Uncheck this option to fit items side-to-side in a shape; and then adjust manually, if needed, using the Item Spacing parameters to achieve seamless edges.

 - The add-on's windows will now hide any time you use any game menu, such as Settings, your Inventory or the Bank.


2018-07-03 - Version 3.8.5


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added a new Setting, "Select and Place" which, when enabled, causes the Group Select keybind to add the targeted item to your selection *as well as* leave the item selected so that you may place the item. When enabled, this allows for even finer control over the mouse cursor *following* a Group Select.
 
 - Added a new Setting, "Hide While Placing" which, when enabled, hides all of the add-on's windows while you are placing an item in the home. Enabling this reduces user interface clutter whenever you need the most screen real estate.


[ Fixes ]

 - Removed the "Drag Items" checkbox to prevent accidental dragging of the currently selected items. Note: You can still "drag and drop" any selected item and have the remaining selected items move along with it by checking the "Link Items" checkbox.


2018-07-01 - Version 3.8.4


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added a Minimize button to the top of the window that will reduce the entire dialog to the title bar only, helping to minimize clutter when the add-on isn't your focus.
 
 - Added the selected item's Icon to the Position window (accessed via the Edit Item Position keybind).


2018-06-30 - Version 3.8.3


[ Fixes ]

2018-06-28 - Version 3.8.2


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added a new option to the "Arrangment" drop down list at the bottom of the main window.

   * "Center between 2 Targets" centers your selected items between two different target items.

 
2018-06-28 - Version 3.8.1


[ Fixes ]

 - Adjusted the "Level with Target" arrange option to level your selected items using their Base Y position rather than their "center" Y position. This should yield more accurate results when leveling multiple items.

 
2018-06-28 - Version 3.8.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added a new drop down list to the bottom of the main window that offers multiple "Arrangement" options:

   * "Center on Target" centers your selected items on a target item.

   * "Level with Target" levels your selected items' bases with the target item's base.

   * "Align with Target's X-Axis" aligns your selected items with the target item's X-Axis.

   * "Align with Target's Y-Axis" aligns your selected items with the target item's Y-Axis.

   * "Align with Target's Z-Axis" aligns your selected items with the target item's Z-Axis.

   * "Match Target Orientation" orients all of your selected items using the same pitch, yaw and roll as the target item.

 - Renamed the "History" tab to "Undo" to clarify where to go to use the Undo / Redo functions.


[ Fixes ]

 - Corrected the tab order of the parameters on the Build tab.


2018-06-26 - Version 3.7.0


[ New Features and Changes ]

 - Added an option to enable/disable automatic rebuilding whenever you change a parameter on the Build tab; added a Build button to the Build tab to manually initiate a build.

 - There is now a more prominent visual indicator displayed on the History line item that is currently active.


[ Fixes ]

 - The Housing Editor should no longer randomly become locked after Essential Housing Tools displays a confirmation dialog window.
 
 - The Selected Items on the Select tab will no longer lose the current scroll position whenever items are Selected or Unselected.

 - The Clipboard Items on the Clipboard tab will no longer lose the current scroll position whenever the clipboard is refreshed.

 - The History tab will no longer lose the current scroll position whenever the history is refreshed.

 - Improved the playback speed of Animations.


2018-06-22 - Version 3.6.0


 - Problematic, off-center furnishings that wobble or move when pitched, rotated or rolled are now automatically offset to compensate for their awkward configuration. The result should be dramatically easier positioning and rotation when using the Build tab.
 
 - Overhauled the Build tab's template parameters to reduce the number of mandatory fields while offering very fine control over the finished product for those who dabble with the additional sliders.

 - Reworked a number of the calculations used by the Build tab's various templates to be more accurate.

 - Improved the speed of item move/rotate operations under certain conditions.

 - Added new Shape Template "Dome" to the Build tab.

 - Addressed an issue that caused the Build tab's [ Reset ] button to set an incorrect origin position for the selected template.

 - Moved the batch job Progress Bar to the bottom of the main window and updated its aesthetics to be more prominent.

 - Moved the batch job Process Name into the Progress Bar.

 
2018-06-20 - Version 3.5.0


 - Added the ability to Load and Save Builds on the Build tab using the [ Load / Save ] button.

 - Corrected the warning message shown when Recording in an Animation Scene that had existing Frames. The message now accurately indicates that new frames will be -inserted- after the current frame, rather than deleting existing frames.

 
2018-06-19 - Version 3.4.1


 - Fixed a UI error that would occur when using the [ Reset ] button on the Build tab.

 
2018-06-19 - Version 3.4.0


 - Added X, Y and Z Position parameters to the Build tab to allow fine control over the exact position of a given build.

 - Revised the calculations used for the "Sphere" Shape Template:

	* Curvature should now be approximated more accurately (within reason relative to the shape of item(s) that you construct with).

	* Item Length, Width and Height are now rotated by the Item Pitch, Yaw and Roll (under the hood) automatically to better fill out the spherical shape with less overlap or empty space between individual items.

 - Added a Help icon to the main add-on window that opens your browser to the YouTube Essential Housing Tools tutorial playlist.
   (updates to the videos will follow soon as most of them were recorded during v1 and v2 of the add-on...)


2018-06-17 - Version 3.3.0


 - The Build tab will now be shared across all houses. Set up a project in one home, rebuild it in another without having to re-enter all of the parameters.

 - Added new Shape Template "Sphere" to the Build tab.

 - Added a warning that appears when switching to the Build tab if the build's position is far from your character's current position -- there is a new Setting that controls the threshold for this warning.
 
 - Added a handy "/clockme" command that starts/stops a timer that clocks your character's movement speed. Run "/clockme" once, preferably while already moving, and run it again to get a report of how far and how fast you moved.


2018-06-16 - Version 3.2.0


 - Added new Shape Template "Rectangle (Filled)" to the Build tab. This template constructs a Solid Rectangle, of "Length" items by "Width" items, such that a Length of 5 and a Width of 5 would require 30 total items.

 - Changed the existing Shape Template "Rectangle" on the Build tab. This template constructs a Rectangle Outline, of "Length" items by "Width" items, such that a Length of 5 and a Width of 5 would require 25 total items.

 - Added Pitch and Roll directional pad to the main window's bottom edit panel.

 - Separated Custom Precision into its own checkbox for clarity in the main window's bottom edit panel.
 
 - Added a Settings button to the top-right of the main window for easy access to the add-on's Settings panel.

 - Added the ability to "tab" to the next/previous slider's text box in the Build tab using TAB and SHIFT+TAB respectively.

 - Added scroll up/down arrows to the Build tab's scroll slider.

 - Adjusted Build tab's scroll slider and mouse wheel scrolling to scroll in a manner that moves from one parameter field to the next.

 - Added Previous Frame ( << ) and Next Frame ( >> ) buttons to the Animate tab.

 - Cleaned up the Animate tab's layout.

 - Added explanatory tool tips for the Build tab's different fields.


2018-06-13 - Version 3.1.0


 - Added a new mode for the Directional Pad on the edit panel. The default is now "Relative," which offers you the option to move your selected items Forward, Backward, Left and Right relative to the direction your character is facing.

   * Note: You may still use the old "Absolute" positioning Directional Pad for North, South, East and West by changing:
Settings > Essential Housing Tools > Editing Items > Directional Editing to Absolute mode.

 - Added a new "Drag Items" checkbox on the edit panel. When enabled, all of your selected items move with you. Move north, they move north with you. Climb up, they move up with you.

 - Renamed the previous "drag-and-drop" checkbox on the edit panel to "Link Items." It continues to do the same thing: when enabled, any changes that you manually make to any selected items are also made to the rest of your selected items. Move one, the rest move with it. Rotate one, the rest rotate around it.

 
2018-06-12 - Version 3.0.1


 - Addressed a deadlock scenario that could occur during the Item Measurement process that takes place during a Build Reset.


2018-06-11 - Version 3.0.0


 - Added three new Build Templates:

   * Cylinder
   * Rectangle
   * Spiral

 - Added three new Add-on Settings to allow you to choose an optional "override" for the Select Mode using the ALT, CTRL and SHIFT keys.  For example, you could set up the CTRL key so that, when pressed while using the Group Select function, the Select Mode will always be "Contiguous (Same As Target)".

 - Reorganized the Add-on Settings panel.

 - Addressed several bugs related to Animation Scene data storage.


2018-06-10 - Version 2.9.9


 - Added setting panel option to automatically clear all houses' current item selections at the time of login.


2018-06-10 - Version 2.9.8

 - Added new Clipboard tab to view the contents of the "virtual" Clipboard (filled using the "Copy" and "Copy From..." buttons).

 - Added new Import / Export Clipboard feature to the Clipboard tab, allowing you to share your creations with other players!


2018-06-06 - Version 2.9.6


 - Enhanced the Gimbal Lock Protection system to avoid 90- and 270-degree angles for certain rotational axes more aggressively and consistently.

   * This feature may be disabled from the add-on's Settings panel; however, this is strongly advised against.


2018-06-05 - Version 2.9.5


 - Organized Shape Template Parameter listing for clarity.

 - Added explanatory tool tips to the Tabs and Select Tab controls.

 - Added ability to right-click selected items to unselect items.

 - Addressed some scenarios related to gimbal locks at 90-degree angles (more to come).


2018-06-01 - Version 2.9.4


 - Added "Cube" Shape Template to the "Build" tab.

 - Added item measurement process to allow for auto-sizing of Cube builds based on the selected items' height, width and length. **Auto-sizing only works for homogeneous item selections that use the items at their default orientation (pitch, yaw, roll = 0)


2018-05-31 - Version 2.9.3


 - Copy from any House's Saved Selections and then Paste to any other House (or the same House).


2018-05-30 - Version 2.9.2


 - Added support for the Bank and Home Storage Containers -- in addition to the player's own Inventory -- when Pasting a group of items from the virtual "Clipboard," or when "fixing" a loaded Saved Scene or Saved Selection that has one or more missing items.

 - Added visual cues for batch updates that are currently in progress, including a progress bar that runs down the side of the main tool window and the name of the batch job in the Title bar.

 - Added a Confirmation dialog that allows the player to choose whether to move the entire group of selected items any time that one of those items is moved/rotated _while the main tool window is closed_. The goal here is to remind a player that may be returning to the home hours, days or weeks later that, if they move one of the grouped items, the entire group will be dragged-and-dropped along with it. (This confirmation dialog allows the user to choose NOT to move the rest of the group with it in the event that they did in fact forget.)


2018-05-28 - Version 2.9.1


 - Added "Select All" button to the "Select" tab to facilitate easier backups of entire homes.


2018-05-24 - Version 2.9.0


 - It has begun. Immaculate Construction is being devoured by Essential Housing Tools. Slowly. Try out the new "Build" tab to construct shapes out of your selected items -- just like Immaculate Construction. More shape templates to come in future updates!

 - Also: Summon your Banker, Merchant or Smuggler right to your side in any of your homes. Just use your Quickslot key bind for any of your assistants and they will be teleported directly to you. Use the Quickslot item again to dismiss them back from whence they came! (Credit to @Aliyavana and @Dolgubon <3)

 - Drag-and-Drop and the Edit Position (X,Y,Z,Pitch,Yaw,Roll) window allow you to move, tilt, rotate and pitch your entire selected group of items by adjusting a single item within the group. Give it a try!

 - Fully integrated the "Oops, I Did It Again!" add-on's multi-level Undo and Redo functionality into Essential Housing Tools. Feel free to uninstall "Oops, I Did It Again" if you had previously installed it -- this add-on will be automatically disabled for you until you do so to prevent any potential conflicts.

 - The entire Essential Housing Tools suite has been reworked to allow for future mergers of my other add-ons (including Immaculate Construction, Oops I Did It Again and Furniture Snap).


2018-05-12 - Version 2.1.5

 - Users may adjust the X, Y, Z, Pitch, Yaw and Roll of a single, targeted item using the Edit Item Position window.

 - Added several confirmation dialogs for actions to mitigate unwanted user edits.


2018-04-06 - Version 1.1.0, 1.1.1
